        "summary": "Recently, multimodal large models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in visual understanding and reasoning across various vision-language tasks. However, MLLMs usually perform poorly in zero-shot medical disease recognition, as they do not fully exploit the captured features and available medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LLaVA-RadZ, a simple yet effective framework for zero-shot medical disease recognition. Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities, which effectively utilizes image and text representations and facilitates robust cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. DKAM improves category-level alignment, allowing for accurate disease recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition and exhibits the state-of-the-art performance compared to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.",

        "summary": "Bearings are critical components in industrial machinery, yet their vulnerability to faults often leads to costly breakdowns. Conventional fault detection methods depend on continuous, high-frequency vibration sensing, digitising, and wireless transmission to the cloud-an approach that significantly drains the limited energy reserves of battery-powered sensors, accelerating their depletion and increasing maintenance costs. This work proposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous vibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to specific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as the key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the machinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital conversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the sensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach, we use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets, examining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also consider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices, and the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested energy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and severities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a diagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance strategy for fault detection in smart machinery.",

        "summary": "Intracluster light (ICL) provides a record of the dynamical interactions undergone by clusters, giving clues on cluster formation and evolution. Here, we analyse the properties of ICL in the massive cluster Abell 2390 at redshift z=0.228. Our analysis is based on the deep images obtained by the Euclid mission as part of the Early Release Observations in the near-infrared (Y, J, H bands), using the NISP instrument in a 0.75 deg$^2$ field. We subtracted a point--spread function (PSF) model and removed the Galactic cirrus contribution in each band after modelling it with the DAWIS software. We then applied three methods to detect, characterise, and model the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the CICLE 2D multi-galaxy fitting; the DAWIS wavelet-based multiscale software; and a mask-based 1D profile fitting. We detect ICL out to 600 kpc. The ICL fractions derived by our three methods range between 18% and 36% (average of 24%), while the BCG+ICL fractions are between 21% and 41% (average of 29%), depending on the band and method. A galaxy density map based on 219 selected cluster members shows a strong cluster substructure to the south-east and a smaller feature to the north-west. Based on colours, the ICL (out to about 400 kpc) seems to be built by the accretion of small systems (M ~ $10^{9.5}$ solar mass), or from stars coming from the outskirts of Milky Way-type galaxies (M ~ $10^{10}$ solar mass). Though Abell 2390 does not seem to be undergoing a merger, it is not yet fully relaxed, since it has accreted two groups that have not fully merged with the cluster core. We estimate that the contributions to the inner 300 kpc of the ICL of the north-west and south-east subgroups are 21% and 9% respectively.",

        "summary": "We study the problem of closeness testing for continuous distributions and its implications for causal discovery. Specifically, we analyze the sample complexity of distinguishing whether two multidimensional continuous distributions are identical or differ by at least $\\epsilon$ in terms of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence under non-parametric assumptions. To this end, we propose an estimator of KL divergence which is based on the von Mises expansion. Our closeness test attains optimal parametric rates under smoothness assumptions. Equipped with this test, which serves as a building block of our causal discovery algorithm to identify the causal structure between two multidimensional random variables, we establish sample complexity guarantees for our causal discovery method. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first work that provides sample complexity guarantees for distinguishing cause and effect in multidimensional non-linear models with non-Gaussian continuous variables in the presence of unobserved confounding.",

        "summary": "Lane topology extraction involves detecting lanes and traffic elements and determining their relationships, a key perception task for mapless autonomous driving. This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by vision-language foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chain-of-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance. We evaluate the method on the OpenLane-V2 dataset, showing consistent improvements across various baseline detectors.

        "summary": "Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional quantum technologies, enabling applications in metrology, secure communication, and measurement-based quantum computing. So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of approximately -8 dB in the fundamental mode, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest recorded for pulsed squeezing. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links. This work completes the set of capabilities needed for robust multimode squeezed light detection and significantly expands its applicability in quantum technologies.",
