        "summary": "Shor's and Grover's algorithms' efficiency and the advancement of quantum computers imply that the cryptography used until now to protect one's privacy is potentially vulnerable to retrospective decryption, also known as \\emph{harvest now, decrypt later} attack in the near future. This dissertation proposes an overview of the cryptographic schemes used by Tor, highlighting the non-quantum-resistant ones and introducing theoretical performance assessment methods of a local Tor network. The measurement is divided into three phases. We will start with benchmarking a local Tor network simulation on constrained devices to isolate the time taken by classical cryptography processes. Secondly, the analysis incorporates existing benchmarks of quantum-secure algorithms and compares these performances on the devices. Lastly, the estimation of overhead is calculated by replacing the measured times of traditional cryptography with the times recorded for Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) execution within the specified Tor environment. By focusing on the replaceable cryptographic components, using theoretical estimations, and leveraging existing benchmarks, valuable insights into the potential impact of PQC can be obtained without needing to implement it fully.",

        "summary": "Phishing URL detection is crucial in cybersecurity as malicious websites disguise themselves to steal sensitive infor mation. Traditional machine learning techniques struggle to per form well in complex real-world scenarios due to large datasets and intricate patterns. Motivated by quantum computing, this paper proposes using Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC) to enhance phishing URL detection. We present PhishVQC, a quantum model that combines quantum feature maps and vari ational ansatzes such as RealAmplitude and EfficientSU2. The model is evaluated across two experimental setups with varying dataset sizes and feature map repetitions. PhishVQC achieves a maximum macro average F1-score of 0.89, showing a 22% improvement over prior studies. This highlights the potential of quantum machine learning to improve phishing detection accuracy. The study also notes computational challenges, with execution wall times increasing as dataset size grows.",

        "summary": "One of the goals of Federated Learning (FL) is to collaboratively train a global model using local models from remote participants. However, the FL process is susceptible to various security challenges, including interception and tampering models, information leakage through shared gradients, and privacy breaches that expose participant identities or data, particularly in sensitive domains such as medical environments. Furthermore, the advent of quantum computing poses a critical threat to existing cryptographic protocols through the Shor and Grover algorithms, causing security concerns in the communication of FL systems. To address these challenges, we propose a Post-Quantum Blockchain-based protocol for Federated Learning (PQBFL) that utilizes post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms and blockchain to enhance model security and participant identity privacy in FL systems. It employs a hybrid communication strategy that combines off-chain and on-chain channels to optimize cost efficiency, improve security, and preserve participant privacy while ensuring accountability for reputation-based authentication in FL systems. The PQBFL specifically addresses the security requirement for the iterative nature of FL, which is a less notable point in the literature. Hence, it leverages ratcheting mechanisms to provide forward secrecy and post-compromise security during all the rounds of the learning process. In conclusion, PQBFL provides a secure and resilient solution for federated learning that is well-suited to the quantum computing era.",

        "summary": "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are blockchain-based organizations that facilitate decentralized governance. Today, DAOs not only hold billions of dollars in their treasury but also govern many of the most popular Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. This paper systematically analyses security threats to DAOs, focusing on the types of attacks they face. We study attacks on DAOs that took place in the past, attacks that have been theorized to be possible, and potential attacks that were uncovered and prevented in audits. For each of these (potential) attacks, we describe and categorize the attack vectors utilized into four categories. This reveals that while many attacks on DAOs take advantage of the less tangible and more complex human nature involved in governance, audits tend to focus on code and protocol vulnerabilities. Thus, additionally, the paper examines empirical data on DAO vulnerabilities, outlines risk factors contributing to these attacks, and suggests mitigation strategies to safeguard against such vulnerabilities.",

        "summary": "Cryptocurrency can be understood as a digital asset transacted among participants in the crypto economy. Every cryptocurrency must have an associated Blockchain. Blockchain is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) which supports cryptocurrencies, this may be considered as the most promising disruptive technology in the industry 4.0 context. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a Blockchain-based financial infrastructure, the term generally refers to an open, permissionless, and highly interoperable protocol stack built on public smart contract platforms, such as the Ethereum Blockchain. It replicates existing financial services in a more open and transparent way. DeFi does not rely on intermediaries and centralized institutions. Instead, it is based on open protocols and decentralized applications (Dapps). Considering that there are many digital coins, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), these currencies should interact among each other sometime. For this interaction the Information Technology elements play an important whole as enablers and IT strategic alignment. This paper considers the strategic alignment model proposed by Henderson and Venkatraman (1993) and Luftman (1996). This paper seeks to answer two main questions 1) What are the common IT elements in the DeFi? And 2) How the elements connect to the IT strategic alignment in DeFi? Through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Results point out that there are many IT elements already mentioned by literature, however there is a lack in the literature about the connection between IT elements and IT strategic alignment in a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) architectural network. After final considerations, limitations and future research agenda are presented. Keywords: IT Strategic alignment, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Cryptocurrency, Digital Economy.",
