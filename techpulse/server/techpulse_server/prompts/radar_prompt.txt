In this format, provide me the same data for subcategories in the field of

applied ai:

data = [
    {
      name: '', //Name of the subcategory
      interest: '', //Interest score    
      innovation: '', //Innovation score
      investments: '', //Investments in billions
      x: 0.64, //Interest: 0 to 1
      y: 0.08, //Innovation: 0 to 1
      z: 36 // Investment in billions
    },
]

make sure all these technologies provide the specialized technologies in each field above with no overlaps. the metrics must make sense with modern data sources, and the investment of every specialized technology must add up to the general technology field above.
