        Innovation (metric_2): 0.01 (growth: 0)
        Relevance to Banking (metric_3): 0.01 (growth: 0)
      
      Rationale: The reviewed articles do not provide any insights or developments related to Quantum Machine Learning in Banking. The focus is primarily on AI, cybersecurity, data privacy, and climate stress testing. These areas, while important to banking, do not highlight any advancements or applications of quantum machine learning. For instance, DroidTTP discusses AI and LLMs for threat detection, while Auspex focuses on AI-based threat modeling, and OTrace addresses privacy with data traceability, none of which involve quantum technologies. Thus, there is no evidence of increased interest, innovation, or relevance of quantum machine learning to banking at this time.
    


      Field Name: Augmented Reality (AR) in Banking
      
      Most Recent Metrics:
        Interest (metric_1): 2.09 (growth: -4.13)
        Innovation (metric_2): 1.78 (growth: -9.64)
        Relevance to Banking (metric_3): 2.85 (growth: -3.06)
      
      Rationale: The articles provided do not directly address developments in Augmented Reality (AR) specific to banking, focusing instead on cybersecurity, privacy, and climate stress testing. Interest in AR remains limited as there are no new significant developments or mass adoption in banking. Innovation in AR is minor, with no transformative changes highlighted in the articles. Relevance to banking remains moderate, as AR could be useful for functions like financial education and remote banking services, but it is not highlighted as a critical or widely adopted technology in the articles. The focus is on broader technological advancements, not directly tied to AR in banking.
    


      Field Name: Quantum Internet in Banking
      
      Most Recent Metrics:
        Interest (metric_1): 1.5 (growth: 0)
        Innovation (metric_2): 3 (growth: 0)
        Relevance to Banking (metric_3): 4 (growth: 0)
      
      Rationale: The Quantum Internet promises to provide unprecedented levels of security for banking transactions through quantum encryption, which is theoretically unbreakable. This could significantly reduce the risk of cyberattacks and fraud, making it a highly relevant technology for the banking sector. While still in the early stages of development, recent advancements in quantum communication protocols and infrastructure suggest that the Quantum Internet could become a critical component of secure banking operations in the future.
