        "summary": "This paper examines the critical challenges and potential solutions for conducting secure and effective external evaluations of general-purpose AI (GPAI) models. With the exponential growth in size, capability, reach and accompanying risk of these models, ensuring accountability, safety, and public trust requires frameworks that go beyond traditional black-box methods. The discussion begins with an analysis of the need for deeper-than-black-box evaluations (Section I), emphasizing the importance of understanding model internals to uncover latent risks and ensure compliance with ethical and regulatory standards. Building on this foundation, Section II addresses the security considerations of remote evaluations, outlining the threat landscape, technical solutions, and safeguards necessary to protect both evaluators and proprietary model data. Finally, Section III synthesizes these insights into actionable recommendations and future directions, aiming to establish a robust, scalable, and transparent framework for external assessments in GPAI governance.",

        "summary": "We propose V2Flow, a novel tokenizer that produces discrete visual tokens capable of high-fidelity reconstruction, while ensuring structural and latent distribution alignment with the vocabulary space of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging this tight visual-vocabulary coupling, V2Flow enables autoregressive visual generation on top of existing LLMs. Our approach formulates visual tokenization as a flow-matching problem, aiming to learn a mapping from a standard normal prior to the continuous image distribution, conditioned on token sequences embedded within the LLMs vocabulary space. The effectiveness of V2Flow stems from two core designs. First, we propose a Visual Vocabulary resampler, which compresses visual data into compact token sequences, with each represented as a soft categorical distribution over LLM's vocabulary. This allows seamless integration of visual tokens into existing LLMs for autoregressive visual generation. Second, we present a masked autoregressive Rectified-Flow decoder, employing a masked transformer encoder-decoder to refine visual tokens into contextually enriched embeddings. These embeddings then condition a dedicated velocity field for precise reconstruction. Additionally, an autoregressive rectified-flow sampling strategy is incorporated, ensuring flexible sequence lengths while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments show that V2Flow outperforms mainstream VQ-based tokenizers and facilitates autoregressive visual generation on top of existing. https://github.com/zhangguiwei610/V2Flow",

Recent approaches that use implicit neural representations have enabled the synthesis of novel views from sparse X-ray images. However, although image synthesis has improved the accuracy, the accuracy of surface shape estimation remains insufficient. Therefore, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing 3D scenes using a Neural Attenuation Surface (NeAS) that simultaneously captures the surface geometry and attenuation coefficient fields. NeAS incorporates a signed distance function (SDF), which defines the attenuation field and aids in extracting the 3D surface within the scene. We conducted experiments using simulated and authentic X-ray images, and the results demonstrated that NeAS could accurately extract 3D surfaces within a scene using only 2D X-ray images.",

However, MLLMs usually perform poorly in zero-shot medical disease recognition, as they do not fully exploit the captured features and available medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LLaVA-RadZ, a simple yet effective framework for zero-shot medical disease recognition. Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities, which effectively utilizes image and text representations and facilitates robust cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. DKAM improves category-level alignment, allowing for accurate disease recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition and exhibits the state-of-the-art performance compared to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.",

So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of approximately -8 dB in the fundamental mode, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest recorded for pulsed squeezing. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links. This work completes the set of capabilities needed for robust multimode squeezed light detection and significantly expands its applicability in quantum technologies.",

Conventional fault detection methods depend on continuous, high-frequency vibration sensing, digitising, and wireless transmission to the cloud-an approach that significantly drains the limited energy reserves of battery-powered sensors, accelerating their depletion and increasing maintenance costs. This work proposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous vibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to specific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as the key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the machinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital conversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the sensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach, we use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets, examining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also consider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices, and the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested energy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and severities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a diagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance strategy for fault detection in smart machinery.",

Our framework integrates both low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and ground clients in the FL training process while utilizing geostationary orbit (GEO) and medium-Earth orbit (MEO) satellites as relays to exchange FL global models across other HAPS constellations worldwide, enabling seamless, global-scale learning. The proposed framework offers several key benefits: (i) enhanced privacy through the decentralization of the FL mechanism by leveraging the HAPS constellation, (ii) improved model accuracy and reduced training loss while balancing latency, (iii) increased scalability of FL systems through ubiquitous connectivity by utilizing MEO and GEO satellites, and (iv) the ability to use FL data, such as resource utilization metrics, to further optimize the NTN architecture from a network management perspective. A numerical study demonstrates the proposed framework's effectiveness, with improved model accuracy, reduced training loss, and efficient latency management.

These vulnerabilities, highlighted by recent global crises, underscore the urgent need for improved visibility and resilience of the supply chain. However, data-sharing limitations often hinder the achievement of comprehensive visibility between organisations or countries due to privacy, security, and regulatory concerns. Moreover, most existing research studies focused on individual firm- or product-level networks, overlooking the multifaceted interactions among diverse entities that characterise real-world supply chains, thus limiting a holistic understanding of supply chain dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) to enhance supply chain visibility through relationship prediction in supply chain knowledge graphs. FL enables collaborative model training across countries by facilitating information sharing without requiring raw data exchange, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and maintaining data security. GCNs empower the framework to capture intricate relational patterns within knowledge graphs, enabling accurate link prediction to uncover hidden connections and provide comprehensive insights into supply chain networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict relationships within country-level supply chain knowledge graphs. This enhanced visibility supports actionable insights, facilitates proactive risk management, and contributes to the development of resilient and adaptive supply chain strategies, ensuring that supply chains are better equipped to navigate the complexities of the global economy.",

However, this approach may still fail to fully preserve data privacy, as models from local clients are exposed to the central server during the aggregation process. This issue becomes even more critical when training vision-language models (VLMs) with FL, as VLMs can easily memorize training data instances, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs). To address this challenge, we propose the FedRand framework, which avoids disclosing the full set of client parameters. In this framework, each client randomly selects subparameters of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from the server and keeps the remaining counterparts of the LoRA weights as private parameters. After training both parameters on the client's private dataset, only the non-private client parameters are sent back to the server for aggregation. This approach mitigates the risk of exposing client-side VLM parameters, thereby enhancing data privacy. We empirically validate that FedRand improves robustness against MIAs compared to relevant baselines while achieving accuracy comparable to methods that communicate full LoRA parameters across several benchmark datasets.",

In particular, to preliminarly test at a cognitive level how well Foundational Visual Language Models (VLMs) compare to Humans in Driving, we move away from bounding boxes, segmentation maps, occupancy maps or trajectory estimation to multi-modal Visual Question Answering (VQA) comparing both humans and machines through a popular method in systems neuroscience known as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). Depending on the type of questions we ask and the answers these systems give, we will show in what cases do VLMs and Humans converge or diverge allowing us to probe on their cognitive alignment. We find that the degree of alignment varies significantly depending on the type of questions asked to each type of system (Humans vs VLMs), highlighting a gap in their alignment.",

To retrieve information from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the relevant subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from the ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval approaches. We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task. We find that while our ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant subgraphs is challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries, often lack consistency and interpretability.

We prove a rigorous version of this phenomenon in the setting of the exponential random graph model (ERGM) through the lens of concentration of measure. To do this, we first present a new general result deriving concentration inequalities in a metastable well from the metastable mixing of a Markov chain with the appropriate stationary distribution, extending a result of Chatterjee [Cha05] which is suited for more traditional forms of global mixing. We then apply this result to the supercritical (low-temperature) ERGM which was recently proven to exhibit metastable mixing by Bresler, Nagaraj, and Nichani [BNN24], and obtain a novel concentration inequality for Lipschitz observables of the supercritical ERGM conditioned on a large metastable well, answering a question posed by [BNN24]. This extends a result of Ganguly and Nam [GN24] from the subcritical (high-temperature) regime to a metastable well in the supercritical regime, and we are also able to extend the applications of their concentration inequality to these metastable wells. Namely, we obtain an upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the ERGM conditioned on a metastable well and an appropriate Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi model, as well as derive a central limit theorem for the count of edges in certain small subcollections of possible edges.

We study this problem in two cases namely rank (1,1) and rank (0,2) depending on the order of vanishing of $ L $-functions at central critical values. This work is a quadratic totally real generalization of (algebraic) factorization result obtained by B\\\"{u}y\\\"{u}kboduk et al. in the spirit of work by Greenberg and Palvannan. Notably, this is the first result in the higher rank (0,2) case.",

        "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning without directly sharing individual's raw data. FL can be implemented in either a centralized (server-based) or decentralized (peer-to-peer) manner. In this survey, we present a novel perspective: the fundamental difference between centralized FL (CFL) and decentralized FL (DFL) is not merely the network topology, but the underlying training protocol: separate aggregation vs. joint optimization. We argue that this distinction in protocol leads to significant differences in model utility, privacy preservation, and robustness to attacks. We systematically review and categorize existing works in both CFL and DFL according to the type of protocol they employ. This taxonomy provides deeper insights into prior research and clarifies how various approaches relate or differ. Through our analysis, we identify key gaps in the literature. In particular, we observe a surprising lack of exploration of DFL approaches based on distributed optimization methods, despite their potential advantages. We highlight this under-explored direction and call for more research on leveraging distributed optimization for federated learning. Overall, this work offers a comprehensive overview from centralized to decentralized FL, sheds new light on the core distinctions between approaches, and outlines open challenges and future directions for the field.",

Here, we analyse the properties of ICL in the massive cluster Abell 2390 at redshift z=0.228. Our analysis is based on the deep images obtained by the Euclid mission as part of the Early Release Observations in the near-infrared (Y, J, H bands), using the NISP instrument in a 0.75 deg$^2$ field. We subtracted a point--spread function (PSF) model and removed the Galactic cirrus contribution in each band after modelling it with the DAWIS software. We then applied three methods to detect, characterise, and model the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the CICLE 2D multi-galaxy fitting; the DAWIS wavelet-based multiscale software; and a mask-based 1D profile fitting. We detect ICL out to 600 kpc. The ICL fractions derived by our three methods range between 18% and 36% (average of 24%), while the BCG+ICL fractions are between 21% and 41% (average of 29%), depending on the band and method. A galaxy density map based on 219 selected cluster members shows a strong cluster substructure to the south-east and a smaller feature to the north-west. Based on colours, the ICL (out to about 400 kpc) seems to be built by the accretion of small systems (M ~ $10^{9.5}$ solar mass), or from stars coming from the outskirts of Milky Way-type galaxies (M ~ $10^{10}$ solar mass). Though Abell 2390 does not seem to be undergoing a merger, it is not yet fully relaxed, since it has accreted two groups that have not fully merged with the cluster core. We estimate that the contributions to the inner 300 kpc of the ICL of the north-west and south-east subgroups are 21% and 9% respectively.",

In order to understand better the underlying mechanism of plant response to Pi, the response to phosphate starvation in Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated through use of Petri Nets, a formal language suitable for bio-modeling. A. thaliana displays a range of responses to deal with Pi starvation, but special attention was paid to root hair elongation in this study. A central player in the root hair pathway is the transcription factor ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6-LIKE 4 (RSL4), which has been found to be upregulated during the Pi stress. A Petri Net was created which could simulate the gene regulatory networks responsible for the increase in root hair length, as well as the resulting increase in root hair length. Notably, discrepancies between the model and the literature suggested an important role for RSL2 in regulating RSL4. In the future, the net designed in the current study could be used as a platform to develop hypotheses about the interaction between RSL2 and RSL4.",

In particular, to preliminarly test at a cognitive level how well Foundational Visual Language Models (VLMs) compare to Humans in Driving, we move away from bounding boxes, segmentation maps, occupancy maps or trajectory estimation to multi-modal Visual Question Answering (VQA) comparing both humans and machines through a popular method in systems neuroscience known as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). Depending on the type of questions we ask and the answers these systems give, we will show in what cases do VLMs and Humans converge or diverge allowing us to probe on their cognitive alignment. We find that the degree of alignment varies significantly depending on the type of questions asked to each type of system (Humans vs VLMs), highlighting a gap in their alignment.",

By aligning design thinking with hope theory -- framework of viewing hope as \"goal-directed,\" \"pathways,\" and \"agentic\" thinking processes -- we aim to examine how researchers can move beyond focusing on harm mitigation and instead reimagine alternative futures. Through hands-on activities, participants will engage in problem reframing, develop a taxonomy of design methods related to hope, and explore how community-driven design approaches can sustain efforts toward societal and individual hope. The workshop also interrogates the ethical and practical boundaries of leveraging hope in design research. By the end of the session, participants will leave with concrete strategies for integrating a hopeful design approach into their research, as well as a network for ongoing collaboration. Ultimately, we position hopeful design not just as a practical tool for action and problem-solving but as a catalyst for cultivating resilience and envisioning transformative futures.",

We assume that only the fast variable $x(t)$ resets to its initial state $x_0$ at a random sequence of times generated from a Poisson process of rate $r$. Fixing the slow variable, we determine the parameterized probability density $p(x,t|y)$, which is the solution to a modified Liouville equation. We then show how for $r\\gg \\epsilon$ the slow dynamics can be approximated by the averaged equation $dy/d\\tau=\\E[x|y]-y$ where $\\tau=\\epsilon t$, $\\E[x|y]=\\int x p^*(x|y)dx$ and $p^*(x|y)=\\lim_{t\\rightarrow \\infty}p(x,t|y)$. We illustrate the theory for $f(x)$ given by the cubic function of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. We find that the slow variable typically converges to an $r$-dependent fixed point $y^*$ that is a solution of the equation $y^*=\\E[x|y^*]$. Finally, we numerically explore deviations from averaging theory when $r=O(\\epsilon)$.",

To gain this understanding we use a case-study subset of the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) dataset as well as a corpus of raw text scraped from the online news articles. To retrieve information from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the relevant subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from the ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval approaches. We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task. We find that while our ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant subgraphs is challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries, often lack consistency and interpretability. Our findings suggest benefits of a synergistic approach between ontology and LLM-based KG construction, with proposed avenues toward that end.",

We assume that only the fast variable $x(t)$ resets to its initial state $x_0$ at a random sequence of times generated from a Poisson process of rate $r$. Fixing the slow variable, we determine the parameterized probability density $p(x,t|y)$, which is the solution to a modified Liouville equation. We then show how for $r\\gg \\epsilon$ the slow dynamics can be approximated by the averaged equation $dy/d\\tau=\\E[x|y]-y$ where $\\tau=\\epsilon t$, $\\E[x|y]=\\int x p^*(x|y)dx$ and $p^*(x|y)=\\lim_{t\\rightarrow \\infty}p(x,t|y)$. We illustrate the theory for $f(x)$ given by the cubic function of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. We find that the slow variable typically converges to an $r$-dependent fixed point $y^*$ that is a solution of the equation $y^*=\\E[x|y^*]$.

In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from the ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval approaches. We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task. We find that while our ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant subgraphs is challenging.

Through hands-on activities, participants will engage in problem reframing, develop a taxonomy of design methods related to hope, and explore how community-driven design approaches can sustain efforts toward societal and individual hope. The workshop also interrogates the ethical and practical boundaries of leveraging hope in design research. By the end of the session, participants will leave with concrete strategies for integrating a hopeful design approach into their research, as well as a network for ongoing collaboration. Ultimately, we position hopeful design not just as a practical tool for action and problem-solving but as a catalyst for cultivating resilience and envisioning transformative futures.",

        "summary": "In this paper we explore the effects of instantaneous stochastic resetting on a planar slow-fast dynamical system of the form $\\dot{x}=f(x)-y$ and $\\dot{y}=\\epsilon (x-y)$ with $0<\\epsilon \\ll 1$. We assume that only the fast variable $x(t)$ resets to its initial state $x_0$ at a random sequence of times generated from a Poisson process of rate $r$. Fixing the slow variable, we determine the parameterized probability density $p(x,t|y)$, which is the solution to a modified Liouville equation. We then show how for $r\\gg \\epsilon$ the slow dynamics can be approximated by the averaged equation $dy/d\\tau=\\E[x|y]-y$ where $\\tau=\\epsilon t$, $\\E[x|y]=\\int x p^*(x|y)dx$ and $p^*(x|y)=\\lim_{t\\rightarrow \\infty}p(x,t|y)$. We illustrate the theory for $f(x)$ given by the cubic function of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. We find that the slow variable typically converges to an $r$-dependent fixed point $y^*$ that is a solution of the equation $y^*=\\E[x|y^*]$. Finally, we numerically explore deviations from averaging theory when $r=O(\\epsilon)$.",

        "summary": "We develop methods for systematic construction of superintegrable polynomials in matrix/eigenvalue models. Our consideration is based on a tight connection of superintegrable property of Gaussian Hermitian model and $W_{1 + \\infty}$ algebra in Fock representation. Motivated by this example, we propose a set of assumptions that may allow one to recover superintegrable polynomials. The main two assumptions are box adding/removing rule (Pierri rule) and existence of Hamiltonian for superintegrable polynomials. We detail our method in case of the Gaussian Hermitian model, and then apply it to the cubic Kontsevich model.",

        "summary": "In this work we study various Retrieval Augmented Regeneration (RAG) approaches to gain an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in a question-answering analysis. To gain this understanding we use a case-study subset of the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) dataset as well as a corpus of raw text scraped from the online news articles. To retrieve information from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the relevant subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from the ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval approaches. We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task. We find that while our ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant subgraphs is challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries, often lack consistency and interpretability. Our findings suggest benefits of a synergistic approach between ontology and LLM-based KG construction, with proposed avenues toward that end.",
