        "summary": "Recently, multimodal large models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in visual understanding and reasoning across various vision-language tasks. However, MLLMs usually perform poorly in zero-shot medical disease recognition, as they do not fully exploit the captured features and available medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LLaVA-RadZ, a simple yet effective framework for zero-shot medical disease recognition. Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities, which effectively utilizes image and text representations and facilitates robust cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. DKAM improves category-level alignment, allowing for accurate disease recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition and exhibits the state-of-the-art performance compared to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.",

        "summary": "Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional quantum technologies, enabling applications in metrology, secure communication, and measurement-based quantum computing. So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of approximately -8 dB in the fundamental mode, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest recorded for pulsed squeezing. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links. This work completes the set of capabilities needed for robust multimode squeezed light detection and significantly expands its applicability in quantum technologies.",

        "summary": "Lane topology extraction involves detecting lanes and traffic elements and determining their relationships, a key perception task for mapless autonomous driving. This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by vision-language foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chain-of-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance. We evaluate the method on the OpenLane-V2 dataset, showing consistent improvements across various baseline detectors.

Here, we analyse the properties of ICL in the massive cluster Abell 2390 at redshift z=0.228. Our analysis is based on the deep images obtained by the Euclid mission as part of the Early Release Observations in the near-infrared (Y, J, H bands), using the NISP instrument in a 0.75 deg$^2$ field. We subtracted a point--spread function (PSF) model and removed the Galactic cirrus contribution in each band after modelling it with the DAWIS software. We then applied three methods to detect, characterise, and model the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the CICLE 2D multi-galaxy fitting; the DAWIS wavelet-based multiscale software; and a mask-based 1D profile fitting. We detect ICL out to 600 kpc. The ICL fractions derived by our three methods range between 18% and 36% (average of 24%), while the BCG+ICL fractions are between 21% and 41% (average of 29%), depending on the band and method. A galaxy density map based on 219 selected cluster members shows a strong cluster substructure to the south-east and a smaller feature to the north-west. Based on colours, the ICL (out to about 400 kpc) seems to be built by the accretion of small systems (M ~ $10^{9.5}$ solar mass), or from stars coming from the outskirts of Milky Way-type galaxies (M ~ $10^{10}$ solar mass). Though Abell 2390 does not seem to be undergoing a merger, it is not yet fully relaxed, since it has accreted two groups that have not fully merged with the cluster core. We estimate that the contributions to the inner 300 kpc of the ICL of the north-west and south-east subgroups are 21% and 9% respectively.",

Previous attacks often utilize multiple reference models to approximate the conditional score distribution, leading to significant computational overhead. While recent work leverages quantile regression to estimate conditional thresholds, it fails to capture epistemic uncertainty, resulting in bias in low-density regions. In this work, we propose a novel approach - Bayesian Membership Inference Attack (BMIA), which performs conditional attack through Bayesian inference. In particular, we transform a trained reference model into Bayesian neural networks by Laplace approximation, enabling the direct estimation of the conditional score distribution by probabilistic model parameters. Our method addresses both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty with only a reference model, enabling efficient and powerful MIA. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of BMIA.",

        "summary": "Although large visual-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in multimodal tasks, errors may occasionally arise due to biases during the reasoning process. Recently, reward models (RMs) have become increasingly pivotal in the reasoning process. Specifically, process RMs evaluate each reasoning step, outcome RMs focus on the assessment of reasoning results, and critique RMs perform error analysis on the entire reasoning process, followed by corrections. However, existing benchmarks for vision-language RMs (VLRMs) typically assess only a single aspect of their capabilities (e.g., distinguishing between two answers), thus limiting the all-round evaluation and restricting the development of RMs in the visual-language domain. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark, dubbed as VLRMBench, encompassing 12,634 questions. VLRMBench is constructed based on three distinct types of datasets, covering mathematical reasoning, hallucination understanding, and multi-image understanding. We design 12 tasks across three major categories, focusing on evaluating VLRMs in the aspects of process understanding, outcome judgment, and critique generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on 21 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models, highlighting the challenges posed by VLRMBench. For instance, in the `Forecasting Future', a binary classification task, the advanced GPT-4o achieves only a 76.0% accuracy. Additionally, we perform comprehensive analytical studies, offering valuable insights for the future development of VLRMs. We anticipate that VLRMBench will serve as a pivotal benchmark in advancing VLRMs. Code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/JCruan519/VLRMBench.",

On the other hand, it often encounters the dilemma among anchor features, model size, and rendering quality - large anchor features lead to large 3D models and high-quality rendering whereas reducing anchor features degrades Gaussian attribute prediction which leads to clear artifacts in the rendered textures and geometries. We design SOGS, an anchor-based 3D-GS technique that introduces second-order anchors to achieve superior rendering quality and reduced anchor features and model size simultaneously. Specifically, SOGS incorporates covariance-based second-order statistics and correlation across feature dimensions to augment features within each anchor, compensating for the reduced feature size and improving rendering quality effectively. In addition, it introduces a selective gradient loss to enhance the optimization of scene textures and scene geometries, leading to high-quality rendering with small anchor features. Extensive experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks show that SOGS achieves superior rendering quality in novel view synthesis with clearly reduced model size.",

This study presents an advanced evaluation of the developed open-source fabrication software Augmented Carpentry (AC), focusing on the technical challenges, potential bottlenecks, and precision of the proposed system, which is designed to recognize both objects and tools. In the workflow, computer vision tools and sensors implement inside-out tracking techniques for the retrofitting tools. This method enables operators to perform precise saw-cutting and drilling tasks using computer-generated feedback. In the design and manufacturing process pipeline, manual fabrication tasks are performed directly from the computer-aided design environment, as computer numerical control machines are widely used in the timber construction industry. Traditional non-digital methods employing execution drawings, markings, and jigs can now be replaced, and manual labor can be directly integrated into the digital value chain. First, this paper introduces the developed methodology and explains its devices and functional phases in detail. Second, the fabrication methodology is evaluated by experimentally scanning the produced one-to-one scale mock-up elements and comparing the discrepancies with their respective three-dimensional execution models. Finally, improvements and limitations in the tool-aware fabrication process, as well as the potential impact of AC in the digital timber fabrication landscape, are discussed.",

This study explores the various aspects of geometry and surface quality control for 3D concrete printing (3DCP), with a particular emphasis on deposition-based methods, namely extrusion and shotcrete 3D printing (SC3DP). A comprehensive overview of existing quality control (QC) methods and strategies is provided and preceded by an in-depth discussion. Four categories of data capture technologies are investigated and their advantages and limitations in the context of AMC are discussed. Additionally, the effects of environmental conditions and objects' properties on data capture are also analyzed. The study extends to automated data capture planning methods for different sensors. Furthermore, various quality control strategies are explored across different stages of the fabrication cycle of the printed object including: (i) During printing, (ii) Layer-wise, (iii) Preassembly, and (iv) Assembly. In addition to reviewing the methods already applied in AMC, we also address various research gaps and future trends and highlight potential methodologies from adjacent domains that could be transferred to AMC.",

Recent open-set methods leverage text prompts, visual cues, or prompt-free paradigm to overcome this, but often compromise between performance and efficiency due to high computational demands or deployment complexity. In this work, we introduce YOLOE, which integrates detection and segmentation across diverse open prompt mechanisms within a single highly efficient model, achieving real-time seeing anything. For text prompts, we propose Re-parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) strategy. It refines pretrained textual embeddings via a re-parameterizable lightweight auxiliary network and enhances visual-textual alignment with zero inference and transferring overhead. For visual prompts, we present Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE). It employs decoupled semantic and activation branches to bring improved visual embedding and accuracy with minimal complexity. For prompt-free scenario, we introduce Lazy Region-Prompt Contrast (LRPC) strategy. It utilizes a built-in large vocabulary and specialized embedding to identify all objects, avoiding costly language model dependency. Extensive experiments show YOLOE's exceptional zero-shot performance and transferability with high inference efficiency and low training cost. Notably, on LVIS, with 3$\\times$ less training cost and 1.4$\\times$ inference speedup, YOLOE-v8-S surpasses YOLO-Worldv2-S by 3.5 AP. When transferring to COCO, YOLOE-v8-L achieves 0.6 AP$^b$ and 0.4 AP$^m$ gains over closed-set YOLOv8-L with nearly 4$\\times$ less training time.

Conventional fault detection methods depend on continuous, high-frequency vibration sensing, digitising, and wireless transmission to the cloud-an approach that significantly drains the limited energy reserves of battery-powered sensors, accelerating their depletion and increasing maintenance costs. This work proposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous vibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to specific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as the key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the machinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital conversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the sensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach, we use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets, examining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also consider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices, and the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested energy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and severities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a diagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance strategy for fault detection in smart machinery.",

Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches.

However conventional ITR systems typically only rely on global image or text representations for measuring patient image/report similarities, which overlook local distinctiveness across patient cases. This often results in suboptimal retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose an Anatomical Location-Conditioned Image-Text Retrieval (ALC-ITR) framework, which, given a query image and the associated suspicious anatomical region(s), aims to retrieve similar patient cases exhibiting the same disease or symptoms in the same anatomical region. To perform location-conditioned multimodal retrieval, we learn a medical Relevance-Region-Aligned Vision Language (RRA-VL) model with semantic global-level and region-/word-level alignment to produce generalizable, well-aligned multi-modal representations. Additionally, we perform location-conditioned contrastive learning to further utilize cross-pair region-level contrastiveness for improved multi-modal retrieval. We show that our proposed RRA-VL achieves state-of-the-art localization performance in phase-grounding tasks, and satisfying multi-modal retrieval performance with or without location conditioning. Finally, we thoroughly investigate the generalizability and explainability of our proposed ALC-ITR system in providing explanations and preliminary diagnosis reports given retrieved patient cases (conditioned on anatomical regions), with proper off-the-shelf LLM prompts.",

Via a perturbative approach, we quantify the cross-talk errors from transverse residual couplings and show that they scale as $nm^2$ where $n$ is the number of idle qubits and $m$ is the ratio between the transverse residual and active couplings. Setting an error threshold $E_\\mathrm{thr}$, we demonstrate that cross-talks restrict the hardware topology and prevent the full use of all-to-all connectivity.

We show in addition, that the speed of propagation for this mode vanishes, indicating the presence of another type of strong coupling. To further investigate this, we extend our analysis to the Bianchi Type I Universe, with the most general solution for the vector field. We show that the extra degree of freedom remains in the theory. Among the modes, we further show that the mode with vanishing speed of propagation is still present, pointing to the strong coupling.

However, current understanding of algorithm design primitives for computationally efficient exploration with language models is limited. To better understand how to leverage access to powerful pre-trained generative models to improve the efficiency of exploration, we introduce a new computational framework for RL with language models, in which the learner interacts with the model through a sampling oracle. Focusing on the linear softmax model parameterization, we provide new results that reveal the computational-statistical tradeoffs of efficient exploration: 1. Necessity of coverage: Coverage refers to the extent to which the pre-trained model covers near-optimal responses -- a form of hidden knowledge. We show that coverage, while not necessary for data efficiency, lower bounds the runtime of any algorithm in our framework. 2. Inference-time exploration: We introduce a new algorithm, SpannerSampling, which obtains optimal data efficiency and is computationally efficient whenever the pre-trained model enjoys sufficient coverage, matching our lower bound. SpannerSampling leverages inference-time computation with the pre-trained model to reduce the effective search space for exploration. 3. Insufficiency of training-time interventions: We contrast the result above by showing that training-time interventions that produce proper policies cannot achieve similar guarantees in polynomial time. 4. Computational benefits of multi-turn exploration: Finally, we show that under additional representational assumptions, one can achieve improved runtime (replacing sequence-level coverage with token-level coverage) through multi-turn exploration.",

In recent years, collaborators across Europe and the United States have been working on CPU vectorisation of LO event generation within the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework, as well as porting it to GPUs, to major success. Recently, development has also started on vectorising NLO event generation. Due to the more complicated nature of NLO amplitudes this development faces several difficulties not accounted for in the LO development, but it shows promise. Here, we present these issues as well as the current status of our event-parallel NLO implementation.",

        "summary": "Cloud computing offers flexibility in resource provisioning, allowing an organization to host its batch processing workloads cost-efficiently by dynamically scaling the size and composition of a cloud-based cluster -- a collection of instances provisioned from the cloud. However, existing schedulers fail to minimize total cost due to suboptimal task and instance scheduling strategies, interference between co-located tasks, and instance provisioning overheads. We present Eva, a scheduler for cloud-based clusters that reduces the overall cost of hosting long-running batch jobs. Eva leverages reservation price from economics to derive the optimal set of instances to provision and task-to-instance assignments. Eva also takes into account performance degradation when co-locating tasks and quantitatively evaluates the trade-off between short-term migration overhead and long-term provision savings when considering a change in cluster configuration. Experiments on AWS EC2 and large-scale trace-driven simulations demonstrate that Eva reduces costs by 42\\% while incurring only a 15\\% increase in JCT, compared to provisioning a separate instance for each task.",

        "summary": "The adoption of Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) radar devices for human sensing, particularly gait recognition, has recently gathered significant attention due to their efficiency, resilience to environmental conditions, and privacy-preserving nature. In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of Open-set Gait Recognition (OSGR) from sparse mmWave radar point clouds. Unlike most existing research, which assumes a closed-set scenario, our work considers the more realistic open-set case, where unknown subjects might be present at inference time, and should be correctly recognized by the system. Point clouds are well-suited for edge computing applications with resource constraints, but are more significantly affected by noise and random fluctuations than other representations, like the more common micro-Doppler signature. This is the first work addressing open-set gait recognition with sparse point cloud data. To do so, we propose a novel neural network architecture that combines supervised classification with unsupervised reconstruction of the point clouds, creating a robust, rich, and highly regularized latent space of gait features. To detect unknown subjects at inference time, we introduce a probabilistic novelty detection algorithm that leverages the structured latent space and offers a tunable trade-off between inference speed and prediction accuracy. Along with this paper, we release mmGait10, an original human gait dataset featuring over five hours of measurements from ten subjects, under varied walking modalities. Extensive experimental results show that our solution attains F1-Score improvements by 24% over state-of-the-art methods, on average, and across multiple openness levels.",

The simultaneous breaking of the inversion symmetry ($\\mathcal{IS}$) and the time-reversal symmetry ($\\mathcal{TRS}$), indispensable for the Josephson diode effect (JDE), is achieved solely via the two Floquet drives that differ by a finite phase, which eventually results in a nonreciprocal current, and hence yields a finite JDE. It may be noted that the Floquet Majorana modes generated at both the far ends of the KCs (away from the QD) and adjacent to the QD junctions mediate the JC owing to a finite superconducting (SC) phase difference in the two KCs. We calculate the time-averaged JC and inspect the tunability of the current-phase relation (CPR) to ascertain the diode characteristics. The asymmetric Floquet drive also manifests an anomalous JC signature in our KC-QD-KC JJ. Furthermore, additional control over the QD energy level can be achieved via an external gate voltage that renders flexibility for the Josephson diode (JD) to act as an SC switching device. Tuning different system parameters, such as the chemical potential of the KCs, Floquet frequency, the relative phase mismatch of the drives, and the gate voltage, our model shows the highest possible rectification to be around $70\\%$. Summarizing, our study provides an alternative scenario, replacing the traditional usage of an external magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling effects in a JD via asymmetrically driven Kitaev leads that entail Majorana-mediated transport.",

We propose to estimate this uncertainty by adapting loss prediction from the uncertainty quantification literature. To this end, we introduce a novel light-weight module, dubbed CATPlan, that is trained to decode motion and planning embeddings into estimates of the collision loss used to partially supervise end-to-end AD systems. During inference, these estimates are interpreted as collision risk. We evaluate CATPlan on the safety-critical, nerf-based, closed-loop benchmark NeuroNCAP and find that it manages to detect collisions with a $54.8\\%$ relative improvement to average precision over a GMM-based baseline in which the predicted trajectory is compared to the forecasted trajectories of other road users. Our findings indicate that the addition of CATPlan can lead to safer end-to-end AD systems and hope that our work will spark increased interest in uncertainty quantification for such systems.",

Traditional catalyst evaluation methods primarily rely on machine learning techniques; however, these methods often struggle to process multi-source heterogeneous data, limiting both predictive accuracy and generalization. To address these limitations, this study introduces the Embedding-Attention-Permutated CNN-Residual (EAPCR) deep learning model. EAPCR constructs a feature association matrix using embedding and attention mechanisms and enhances predictive performance through permutated CNN architectures and residual connections. This approach enables the model to accurately capture complex feature interactions across various catalytic conditions, leading to precise efficiency predictions. EAPCR serves as a powerful tool for computational researchers while also assisting domain experts in optimizing catalyst design, effectively bridging the gap between data-driven modeling and experimental applications. We evaluate EAPCR on datasets from TiO2 photocatalysis, thermal catalysis, and electrocatalysis, demonstrating its superiority over traditional machine learning methods (e.g., linear regression, random forest) as well as conventional deep learning models (e.g., ANN, NNs). Across multiple evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R2, and RMSE), EAPCR consistently outperforms existing approaches. These findings highlight the strong potential of EAPCR in inorganic catalytic efficiency prediction. As a versatile deep learning framework, EAPCR not only improves predictive accuracy but also establishes a solid foundation for future large-scale model development in inorganic catalysis.",

This concept is central to the development of a 6G architecture that aims to exploit the accelerated compute capabilities for supporting both real-time signal processing and offloading of Generative AI (GenAI) workloads. However, both the architectural framework required to support this vision and the dynamic resource allocation strategy are still in their infancy. The O-RAN architecture intrinsically allows cloud-native disaggregated implementation. Consequently, we explore a framework that can allow orchestration of AI-and-RAN workloads by expanding the Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (NRT-RIC) within O-RAN. The framework incorporates a monitoring xApp that tracks RAN KPIs and exposes radio analytics to the proposed E2E orchestrator via a recently introduced Y1 interface. The orchestrator implements a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically allocate critical computing resources, e.g., Multi-Instance GPUs (MIGs), between latency-sensitive RAN network functions and computationally intensive AI workloads on shared RAN infrastructure. The proposed framework provides insight on how the traditional RAN architecture can be evolved to inherently support emerging GenAI workloads. Our framework prioritizes the real-time requirements of RAN workloads while maintaining efficient resource sharing for AI applications. The simulation results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework, as it meets nearly 99% of the requests for RAN workload while effectively supporting AI workloads and achieving 100% utilization of the RAN infrastructure resources in a dynamic environment.",

Existing methods primarily use asynchronous auto-regressive models or synchronous diffusion models to address this challenge.

To address these issues, we introduce Auto-Regressive Diffusion (AR-Diffusion), a novel model that combines the strengths of auto-regressive and diffusion models for flexible, asynchronous video generation. Specifically, our approach leverages diffusion to gradually corrupt video frames in both training and inference, reducing the discrepancy between these phases. Inspired by auto-regressive generation, we incorporate a non-decreasing constraint on the corruption timesteps of individual frames, ensuring that earlier frames remain clearer than subsequent ones. This setup, together with temporal causal attention, enables flexible generation of videos with varying lengths while preserving temporal coherence. In addition, we design two specialized timestep schedulers: the FoPP scheduler for balanced timestep sampling during training, and the AD scheduler for flexible timestep differences during inference, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves competitive and state-of-the-art results across four challenging benchmarks.",

However, it is often difficult to apply these large models in downstream tasks, due to massive fine-tuning cost. Recently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been applied for efficient tuning of diffusion models. Unfortunately, the capabilities of LoRA-tuned diffusion models are limited, since the same LoRA is used for different timesteps of the diffusion process. To tackle this problem, we introduce a general and concise TimeStep Master (TSM) paradigm with two key fine-tuning stages. In the fostering stage (1-stage), we apply different LoRAs to fine-tune the diffusion model at different timestep intervals. This results in different TimeStep LoRA experts that can effectively capture different noise levels. In the assembling stage (2-stage), we design a novel asymmetrical mixture of TimeStep LoRA experts, via core-context collaboration of experts at multi-scale intervals. For each timestep, we leverage TimeStep LoRA expert within the smallest interval as the core expert without gating, and use experts within the bigger intervals as the context experts with time-dependent gating. Consequently, our TSM can effectively model the noise level via the expert in the finest interval, and adaptively integrate contexts from the experts of other scales, boosting the versatility of diffusion models. To show the effectiveness of our TSM paradigm, we conduct extensive experiments on three typical and popular LoRA-related tasks of diffusion models, including domain adaptation, post-pretraining, and model distillation. Our TSM achieves the state-of-the-art results on all these tasks, throughout various model structures (UNet, DiT and MM-DiT) and visual data modalities (Image, Video), showing its remarkable generalization capacity.",

In this work, we present REF-VLM, an end-to-end framework for unified training of various visual decoding tasks. To address complex visual decoding scenarios, we introduce the Triplet-Based Referring Paradigm (TRP), which explicitly decouples three critical dimensions in visual decoding tasks through a triplet structure: concepts, decoding types, and targets. TRP employs symbolic delimiters to enforce structured representation learning, enhancing the parsability and interpretability of model outputs. Additionally, we construct Visual-Task Instruction Following Dataset (VTInstruct), a large-scale multi-task dataset containing over 100 million multimodal dialogue samples across 25 task types. Beyond text inputs and outputs, VT-Instruct incorporates various visual prompts such as point, box, scribble, and mask, and generates outputs composed of text and visual units like box, keypoint, depth and mask. The combination of different visual prompts and visual units generates a wide variety of task types, expanding the applicability of REF-VLM significantly. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our REF-VLM outperforms other MLLMs across a variety of standard benchmarks.

Most of the molecular ions in the AlX$^+$ series, particularly barring the first two, have been studied here for the first time for their ground state electronic and vibrational structure. The vibrational parameters have been calculated by solving the vibrational Schr\\\"odinger equation utilizing potential energy curves and permanent dipole moment curves. Further, spontaneous and black-body radiation induced lifetimes have also been computed using relative energy separation and the transition dipole moments between the vibrational levels. The lifetimes of the lowest ro-vibrational states are found to be 10.63 s, 40.39 s, 23.13 s, 31.26 s, 13.43 s, and 8.08 s for the AlF$^+$, AlCl$^+$, AlBr$^+$, AlI$^+$, AlAt$^+$, and AlTs$^+$ ions, respectively.

        "summary": "Solving short and long time dynamics of closed quantum many-body systems is one of the main challenges of both atomic and condensed matter physics. For locally interacting closed systems, the dynamics of local observables can always be expanded into (pseudolocal) eigenmodes of the Liouvillian, so called dynamical symmetries. They come in two classes - transient operators, which decay in time and perpetual operators, which either oscillate forever or stay the same (conservation laws). These operators provide a full characterization of the dynamics of the system. Deriving these operators, apart from a very limited class of models, has not been possible. Here, we present a method to numerically and analytically derive some of these dynamical symmetries in infinite closed systems by introducing a naturally emergent open boundary condition on the Krylov chain. This boundary condition defines a partitioning of the Krylov space into system and environment degrees of freedom, where non-local operators make up an effective bath for the local operators. We demonstrate the practicality of the method on some numerical examples and derive analytical results in two idealized cases. Our approach lets us directly relate the operator growth hypothesis to thermalization and exponential decay of observables in chaotic systems.",

Anomaly detection can be used to reduce those risks and increase reliability. In this work, we propose a novel enhanced convolutional neural network (ECNN) to predict the failure of an industrial pump based on the vibration data captured by an acceleration sensor. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed with a focus on low complexity to enable its implementation on edge devices with limited computational resources. Therefore, a detailed design space exploration is performed to find a topology satisfying the trade-off between complexity and accuracy. Moreover, to allow for adaptation to unknown pumps, our algorithm features a pump-specific parameter that can be determined by a small set of normal data samples. Finally, we combine the ECNN with a threshold approach to further increase the performance and satisfy the application requirements. As a result, our combined approach significantly outperforms a traditional statistical approach and a classical CNN in terms of accuracy. To summarize, this work provides a novel, low-complex, CNN-based algorithm that is enhanced by classical methods to offer high accuracy for anomaly detection of industrial pumps.",

This is largely attributed to pretrained representations capturing universal, robust, and generalizable features, which can be reutilized by downstream tasks. However, these representations are later found to gradually vanish during finetuning, accompanied by a degradation of foundation model's original abilities, e.g., generalizability. In this paper, we argue that pretrained representations can be well preserved while still effectively adapting to downstream tasks. We study this by proposing a new finetuning method RepSim, which minimizes the distance between pretrained and finetuned representations via constraining learnable orthogonal manifold based on similarity invariance. Compared to standard finetuning methods, e.g., full finetuning, our method improves representation similarity by over 30% while maintaining competitive accuracy, and reduces sharpness by 42% across five medical image classification datasets.

The key is to treat each agent as relative to its surrounding agents in an environment that is presumed to change dynamically. Hence, in each time step, an agent is the centre of its own neighbourhood and also a neighbour to many other agents. Each role is formulated as a sub-graph, and each sub-graph is used as a training sample. A message-passing neural network supports full-scale vertex and edge interaction within a local neighbourhood, while a parameter governing the depth of the sub-graphs eases the training burden. During testing, an agent's actions are locally ensembled across all the sub-graphs that contain it, resulting in robust decisions. Where other approaches struggle to manage 50 agents, Q-MARL can easily marshal thousands. A detailed theoretical analysis proves improvement and convergence, and simulations with the typical collaborative and competitive scenarios show dramatically faster training speeds and reduced training losses.",

Drawing inspiration from the human's complementary learning system, which excels at rapidly capturing and integrating semantic features from limited examples, we propose the generalization-optimized Systems Consolidation Adaptive Memory Dual-Network, SCAM-Net. This approach simulates the systems consolidation of complementary learning system with an adaptive memory module, which successfully addresses the difficulty of identifying meaningful features in few-shot scenarios. Specifically, we construct a Hippocampus-Neocortex dual-network that consolidates structured representation of each category, the structured representation is then stored and adaptively regulated following the generalization optimization principle in a long-term memory inside Neocortex.

Conventional fault detection methods depend on continuous, high-frequency vibration sensing, digitising, and wireless transmission to the cloud-an approach that significantly drains the limited energy reserves of battery-powered sensors, accelerating their depletion and increasing maintenance costs. This work proposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous vibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to specific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as the key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the machinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital conversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the sensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach, we use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets, examining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also consider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices, and the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested energy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and severities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a diagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance strategy for fault detection in smart machinery.",

These vulnerabilities, highlighted by recent global crises, underscore the urgent need for improved visibility and resilience of the supply chain. However, data-sharing limitations often hinder the achievement of comprehensive visibility between organisations or countries due to privacy, security, and regulatory concerns. Moreover, most existing research studies focused on individual firm- or product-level networks, overlooking the multifaceted interactions among diverse entities that characterise real-world supply chains, thus limiting a holistic understanding of supply chain dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) to enhance supply chain visibility through relationship prediction in supply chain knowledge graphs. FL enables collaborative model training across countries by facilitating information sharing without requiring raw data exchange, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and maintaining data security. GCNs empower the framework to capture intricate relational patterns within knowledge graphs, enabling accurate link prediction to uncover hidden connections and provide comprehensive insights into supply chain networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict relationships within country-level supply chain knowledge graphs. This enhanced visibility supports actionable insights, facilitates proactive risk management, and contributes to the development of resilient and adaptive supply chain strategies, ensuring that supply chains are better equipped to navigate the complexities of the global economy.",

However, this approach may still fail to fully preserve data privacy, as models from local clients are exposed to the central server during the aggregation process. This issue becomes even more critical when training vision-language models (VLMs) with FL, as VLMs can easily memorize training data instances, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs). To address this challenge, we propose the FedRand framework, which avoids disclosing the full set of client parameters. In this framework, each client randomly selects subparameters of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from the server and keeps the remaining counterparts of the LoRA weights as private parameters. After training both parameters on the client's private dataset, only the non-private client parameters are sent back to the server for aggregation. This approach mitigates the risk of exposing client-side VLM parameters, thereby enhancing data privacy. We empirically validate that FedRand improves robustness against MIAs compared to relevant baselines while achieving accuracy comparable to methods that communicate full LoRA parameters across several benchmark datasets.",

Very high efficiency is pursued by discretizing the differential problem in space through the isogeometric collocation (IGA-C) method. The method, in addition to the desirable attributes of isogeometric analysis (IGA), such as exactness of the geometric reconstruction of complex shapes and high-order accuracy, circumvents the need for numerical integration since it discretizes the problem in the strong form. Other distinguishing features of the proposed formulation are: i) ${\\rm SO}(3)$-consistency for the linearization of the problem and for the time stepping; ii) minimal (finite) rotation parametrization, that means only three rotational unknowns are used; iii) no additional unknowns are needed to account for the rate-dependent material compared to the purely elastic case.

To demonstrate the practicality of CBC, we deploy it on a real-world decentralized vision-based robot swarm system. A visual attention network is trained based on the learned interaction graph for online neighbor selection. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous approaches in predicting both the interaction graph and swarm actions with higher accuracy. This work offers a promising approach for understanding interaction mechanisms and swarm dynamics in future swarm robotics research. Code and data are available.",

It introduces a photobioreactor (PBR) fa\\c{c}ade system to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations while addressing the challenge of large-scale prefabricated components transportation. This research introduces a novel approach by designing the fa\\c{c}ade system as modular, user-friendly and transportation-friendly bricks, enabling the creation of a user-customized and self-assembled photobioreactor (PBR) system. The single module in the system is proposed to be \"neutralization bricks\", which embedded with algae and equipped with an air circulation system, facilitating the photobioreactor (PBR)'s functionality. A connection system between modules allows for easy assembly by users, while a limited variety of brick styles ensures modularity in manufacturing without sacrificing customization and diversity. The system is also equipped with an advanced microalgae status detection algorithm, which allows users to monitor the condition of the microalgae using monocular camera.

The results show that big data adoption significantly enhances ESG investing, as data-driven analytics improve sustainability assessments and capital allocation. Financial market development also positively influences ESG investments, but its effect is relatively small. A key finding is that inflation negatively impacts ESG investment, highlighting the importance of macroeconomic stability in fostering sustainable finance. In contrast, GDP per capita and foreign direct investment (FDI) are not significant determinants, suggesting that economic growth alone does not drive sustainability efforts. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence that leveraging big data and financial market improvements can accelerate sustainable investing in emerging economies.

        "summary": "Accurate food intake monitoring is crucial for maintaining a healthy diet and preventing nutrition-related diseases. With the diverse range of foods consumed across various cultures, classic food classification models have limitations due to their reliance on fixed-sized food datasets. Studies show that people consume only a small range of foods across the existing ones, each consuming a unique set of foods. Existing class-incremental models have low accuracy for the new classes and lack personalization. This paper introduces a personalized, class-incremental food classification model designed to overcome these challenges and improve the performance of food intake monitoring systems. Our approach adapts itself to the new array of food classes, maintaining applicability and accuracy, both for new and existing classes by using personalization. Our model's primary focus is personalization, which improves classification accuracy by prioritizing a subset of foods based on an individual's eating habits, including meal frequency, times, and locations. A modified version of DSN is utilized to expand on the appearance of new food classes. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive framework that integrates this model into a food intake monitoring system. This system analyzes meal images provided by users, makes use of a smart scale to estimate food weight, utilizes a nutrient content database to calculate the amount of each macro-nutrient, and creates a dietary user profile through a mobile application. Finally, experimental evaluations on two new benchmark datasets FOOD101-Personal and VFN-Personal, personalized versions of well-known datasets for food classification, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in improving the classification accuracy of both new and existing classes, addressing the limitations of both conventional and class-incremental food classification models.",

Most existing design methodologies have predominantly relied on trajectory synthesis, which inadvertently prioritizes less critical performance aspects. This study proposes a hierarchical multi-objective optimization strategy to address this limitation. First, the numerical performance-trajectory mapping is derived based on a foot-ground contact model, aiming to decouple the performance characteristics. Subsequently, a hierarchical optimization strategy is employed for two CLM design scenarios: In trajectory shape-constrained scenarios, a coarse-to-fine optimization process, integrating Fourier descriptors, refines the design from overall shape to local features. In scenarios without trajectory shape constraints, a stepwise optimization process is proposed for reconfigurable CLMs to transition from primary motion to auxiliary motion. The robustness of the proposed design strategy is validated across three configurations and seven algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed design strategy is verified by comparison with other existing CLM design methods. The applicability of the proposed strategy is confirmed through simulation and prototype experiments. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical strategy effectively addresses the challenges of precise performance design in CLMs. Our work provides a general framework for the CLM design and offers insights for the optimization design of other closed-chain linkages.",

In this paper, we propose a mobility-aware multi-task decentralized federated learning (MMFL) framework for vehicular networks. By this framework, we address task scheduling, subcarrier allocation, and leader selection, as a joint optimization problem, termed as TSLP. For the case with a single FL task, we derive the convergence bound of model training. For general cases, we first model TSLP as a resource allocation game, and prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, based on this proof, we reformulate the game as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP), and develop an algorithm based on heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization (HAPPO) to solve DEC-POMDP. Finally, numerical results are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

Current approaches tend to use graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the momentum spillover effect of risks.

In this paper, we propose CF3, a novel Counterfactual and Factual learning method for company Financial risk detection, which generates evidence subgraphs on company knowledge graphs to reliably detect and explain company financial risks. Specifically, we first propose a meta-path attribution process based on Granger causality, selecting the meta-paths most relevant to the target node labels to construct an attribution subgraph. Subsequently, we propose anedge-type-aware graph generator to identify important edges, and we also devise a layer-based feature masker to recognize crucial node features. Finally, we utilize counterfactual-factual reasoning and a loss function based on attribution subgraphs to jointly guide the learning of the graph generator and feature masker.

This study identifies critical issues such as Transaction Order Dependence (TOD), Blockchain Extractable Value (BEV), and Transaction Importance Diversity (TID), which collectively undermine the fairness and security of DeFi systems. BEV-related activities, including Sandwich attacks, Liquidations, and Transaction Replay, have emerged as significant threats, collectively generating $540.54 million in losses over 32 months across 11,289 addresses, involving 49,691 cryptocurrencies and 60,830 on-chain markets. These attacks exploit transaction mechanics to manipulate asset prices and extract value at the expense of other participants, with Sandwich attacks being particularly impactful. Additionally, the growing adoption of Blockchain in traditional finance highlights the challenge of TID, where high transaction volumes can strain systems and compromise time-sensitive operations. To address these pressing issues, we propose a novel Distributed Transaction Sequencing Strategy (DTSS), which combines forking mechanisms and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to enforce fair and transparent transaction ordering in a decentralized manner. Our approach is further enhanced by an optimization framework and the introduction of the Normalized Allocation Disparity Metric (NADM), which ensures optimal parameter selection for transaction prioritization. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that DTSS effectively mitigates BEV risks, enhances transaction fairness, and significantly improves the security and transparency of DeFi ecosystems.

We ground our approach in the premise that historical patterns, when accurately clustered and pruned, can yield substantial predictive power for short-term price movements. To achieve this, we incorporate an entropy-based measure as a proxy for information gain. Patterns that lead to high one-sided movements in historical data, yet retain low local entropy, are more informative in signaling future market direction. Compared to conventional clustering techniques such as K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), which often yield biased or unbalanced groupings, our approach emphasizes balance over a forced visual boundary, ensuring that quality patterns are not lost due to over-segmentation. By emphasizing both predictive purity (low local entropy) and historical profitability, our method achieves a balanced representation of Buy and Sell patterns, making it better suited for short-term algorithmic trading strategies.",

Considering the native language-supervised advantage of CLIP and the plug-and-play nature of prompt to transfer CLIP efficiently, this paper introduces an uploadable multi-source few-shot domain adaptation (UMFDA) schema. It belongs to a decentralized edge collaborative learning in the edge-side models that must maintain a low computational load. And only a limited amount of annotations in source domain data is provided, with most of the data being unannotated. Further, this paper proposes a vision-aware multimodal prompt tuning framework (VAMP) under the decentralized schema, where the vision-aware prompt guides the text domain-specific prompt to maintain semantic discriminability and perceive the domain information. The cross-modal semantic and domain distribution alignment losses optimize each edge-side model, while text classifier consistency and semantic diversity losses promote collaborative learning among edge-side models. Extensive experiments were conducted on OfficeHome and DomainNet datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VAMP in the UMFDA, which outperformed the previous prompt tuning methods.",

However, the extension of CAI to multi-agent, general-sum stochastic games (SGs) remains underexplored, particularly in decentralized settings where agents operate independently without centralized coordination. In this paper, we propose a novel variational inference framework tailored to decentralized multi-agent systems. Our framework addresses the challenges posed by non-stationarity and unaligned agent objectives, proving that the resulting policies form an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we demonstrate theoretical convergence guarantees for the proposed decentralized algorithms.

However, the iterative exchange of model parameters between the server and clients imposes heavy communication burdens, risks potential privacy leakage, and even precludes collaboration among heterogeneous clients. Distillation-based FL tackles these challenges by exchanging low-dimensional model outputs rather than model parameters, yet it highly relies on a task-relevant auxiliary dataset that is often not available in practice. Data-free FL attempts to overcome this limitation by training a server-side generator to directly synthesize task-specific data samples for knowledge transfer. However, the update rule of the generator requires clients to share on-device models for white-box access, which greatly compromises the advantages of distillation-based FL. This motivates us to explore a data-free and black-box FL framework via Zeroth-order Gradient Estimation (FedZGE), which estimates the gradients after flowing through on-device models in a black-box optimization manner to complete the training of the generator in terms of fidelity, transferability, diversity, and equilibrium, without involving any auxiliary data or sharing any model parameters, thus combining the advantages of both distillation-based FL and data-free FL. Experiments on large-scale image classification datasets and network architectures demonstrate the superiority of FedZGE in terms of data heterogeneity, model heterogeneity, communication efficiency, and privacy protection.",

Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 55% lower average policy error (APE), 35% faster convergence, 50% reduced runtime complexity, and 45% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.",

By identifying this extended problem as equivalent to a certain linear-quadratic stochastic control problem, we can use established results in linear-quadratic stochastic control to solve the extended problem. This work generalizes [Ackermann, Kruse, Urusov; FinancStoch'24] from the single-asset setting to the multi-asset case.

An alternative to improve the number of transactions per second is to use Layer 2 (L2) rollups. L2s perform most computations offchain using blockchains (L1) minimally under-the-hood to guarantee correctness. A sequencer receives offchain L2 transaction requests, batches them, and commits compressed or hashed batches to L1. Hashing offers much better compression but requires a data availability committee (DAC) to translate hashes back into their corresponding batches. Current L2s consist of a centralized sequencer which receives and serializes all transactions and an optional DAC. Centralized sequencers can undesirably influence L2s evolution. We propose in this paper a fully decentralized implementation of a service that combines (1) a sequencer that posts hashes to the L1 blockchain and (2) the data availability committee that reverses the hashes. We call the resulting service a (decentralized) arranger. Our decentralized arranger is based on Set Byzantine Consensus (SBC), a service where participants can propose sets of values and consensus is reached on a subset of the union of the values proposed. We extend SBC for our fully decentralized arranger. Our main contributions are (1) a formal definition of arrangers; (2) two implementations, one with a centralized sequencer and another with a fully decentralized algorithm, with their proof of correctness; and (3) empirical evidence that our solution scales by implementing all building blocks necessary to implement a correct server.",

The MARCF model achieves significant dimension reduction and enables a more flexible and interpretable factor representation of dynamic relationships. We develop a computationally efficient estimator and a gradient descent algorithm.

We propose a new failure cost penalty that applies only when a solution is executed but does not pay its bid or fulfill the order. Combined with an on-chain escrow system, this mechanism empowers applications to asynchronously issue their users a guaranteed minimum outcome before the execution results are finalized. It implies a direct link between blockchain throughput, censorship resistance, and the capital efficiency of auction participants (e.g., solvers), which intuitively extends to execution quality. At equilibrium, bids fully reflect the potential for price improvement between bid submission and execution, but only partially reflect the potential for price declines.

However, EMG signals from deeper muscles are often challenging to measure by placing the surface EMG electrodes and unfeasible to measure directly using invasive methods. The restriction to the access of EMG data from deeper muscles poses a considerable obstacle to the broad adoption of EMG-driven modeling techniques. A strategic alternative is to use an estimation algorithm to approximate the missing EMG signals from deeper muscle. A similar strategy is used in physics-informed deep learning, where the features of physical systems are learned without labeled data. In this work, we propose a hybrid deep learning algorithm, namely the neural musculoskeletal model (NMM), that integrates physics-informed and data-driven deep learning to approximate the EMG signals from the deeper muscles. While data-driven modeling is used to predict the missing EMG signals, physics-based modeling engraves the subject-specific information into the predictions. Experimental verifications on five test subjects are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed hybrid framework. The proposed NMM is validated against the joint torque computed from 'OpenSim' software. The predicted deep EMG signals are also compared against the state-of-the-art muscle synergy extrapolation (MSE) approach, where the proposed NMM completely outperforms the existing MSE framework by a significant margin.",

Robots in the roundabout travel in one direction until an escape condition is met, allowing them to return to goal-oriented motion.

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.",

        "summary": "The automatic reconstruction of 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models from CAD sketches has recently gained significant attention in the computer vision community. Most existing methods, however, rely on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth for supervision, which are often difficult to be obtained in industrial applications and are sensitive to noise inputs. We propose viewing CAD reconstruction as a specific instance of sparse-view 3D reconstruction to overcome these limitations. While this reformulation offers a promising perspective, existing 3D reconstruction methods typically require natural images and corresponding camera poses as inputs, which introduces two major significant challenges: (1) modality discrepancy between CAD sketches and natural images, and (2) difficulty of accurate camera pose estimation for CAD sketches. To solve these issues, we first transform the CAD sketches into representations resembling natural images and extract corresponding masks. Next, we manually calculate the camera poses for the orthographic views to ensure accurate alignment within the 3D coordinate system. Finally, we employ a customized sparse-view 3D reconstruction method to achieve high-quality reconstructions from aligned orthographic views. By leveraging raster CAD sketches for self-supervision, our approach eliminates the reliance on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth. Experiments on the Sub-Fusion360 dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms previous approaches in CAD reconstruction performance and exhibits strong robustness to noisy inputs.",

Traditional approaches to mobile agent training rely on centralized data collection, leading to high cost and limited scalability. Distributed training utilizing federated learning offers an alternative by harnessing real-world user data, providing scalability and reducing costs. However, pivotal challenges, including the absence of standardized benchmarks, hinder progress in this field. To tackle the challenges, we introduce FedMABench, the first benchmark for federated training and evaluation of mobile agents, specifically designed for heterogeneous scenarios. FedMABench features 6 datasets with 30+ subsets, 8 federated algorithms, 10+ base models, and over 800 apps across 5 categories, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating mobile agents across diverse environments. Through extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: federated algorithms consistently outperform local training; the distribution of specific apps plays a crucial role in heterogeneity; and, even apps from distinct categories can exhibit correlations during training. FedMABench is publicly available at: https://github.com/wwh0411/FedMABench with the datasets at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/wwh0411/FedMABench.",

However, MLLMs usually perform poorly in zero-shot medical disease recognition, as they do not fully exploit the captured features and available medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LLaVA-RadZ, a simple yet effective framework for zero-shot medical disease recognition. Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities, which effectively utilizes image and text representations and facilitates robust cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. DKAM improves category-level alignment, allowing for accurate disease recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition and exhibits the state-of-the-art performance compared to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.",

So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of approximately -8 dB in the fundamental mode, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest recorded for pulsed squeezing. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links. This work completes the set of capabilities needed for robust multimode squeezed light detection and significantly expands its applicability in quantum technologies.",

        "summary": "Lane topology extraction involves detecting lanes and traffic elements and determining their relationships, a key perception task for mapless autonomous driving. This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by vision-language foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chain-of-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance. We evaluate the method on the OpenLane-V2 dataset, showing consistent improvements across various baseline detectors.

Here, we analyse the properties of ICL in the massive cluster Abell 2390 at redshift z=0.228. Our analysis is based on the deep images obtained by the Euclid mission as part of the Early Release Observations in the near-infrared (Y, J, H bands), using the NISP instrument in a 0.75 deg$^2$ field. We subtracted a point--spread function (PSF) model and removed the Galactic cirrus contribution in each band after modelling it with the DAWIS software. We then applied three methods to detect, characterise, and model the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the CICLE 2D multi-galaxy fitting; the DAWIS wavelet-based multiscale software; and a mask-based 1D profile fitting. We detect ICL out to 600 kpc. The ICL fractions derived by our three methods range between 18% and 36% (average of 24%), while the BCG+ICL fractions are between 21% and 41% (average of 29%), depending on the band and method. A galaxy density map based on 219 selected cluster members shows a strong cluster substructure to the south-east and a smaller feature to the north-west. Based on colours, the ICL (out to about 400 kpc) seems to be built by the accretion of small systems (M ~ $10^{9.5}$ solar mass), or from stars coming from the outskirts of Milky Way-type galaxies (M ~ $10^{10}$ solar mass). Though Abell 2390 does not seem to be undergoing a merger, it is not yet fully relaxed, since it has accreted two groups that have not fully merged with the cluster core. We estimate that the contributions to the inner 300 kpc of the ICL of the north-west and south-east subgroups are 21% and 9% respectively.",

Previous attacks often utilize multiple reference models to approximate the conditional score distribution, leading to significant computational overhead. While recent work leverages quantile regression to estimate conditional thresholds, it fails to capture epistemic uncertainty, resulting in bias in low-density regions. In this work, we propose a novel approach - Bayesian Membership Inference Attack (BMIA), which performs conditional attack through Bayesian inference. In particular, we transform a trained reference model into Bayesian neural networks by Laplace approximation, enabling the direct estimation of the conditional score distribution by probabilistic model parameters. Our method addresses both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty with only a reference model, enabling efficient and powerful MIA. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of BMIA.",

Base on the observation that walking data captures valuable movement patterns transferable across tasks and, on the other hand, the advanced kinematic methods can generate diverse grasping poses, which can then be interpolated into motions to serve as task-specific guidance. Our approach incorporates an active data generation strategy to maximize the utility of the generated motions, along with a local feature alignment mechanism that transfers natural movement patterns from walking data to enhance both the success rate and naturalness of the synthesized motions. By combining the fidelity and stability of natural walking with the flexibility and generalizability of task-specific generated data, our method demonstrates strong performance and robust adaptability in diverse scenes and with unseen objects.",

A classic study by Taylor (2022) showed that heavy inertial point particles (having density parameter R = 1) are trapped by the flow separatrices when the particle Stokes number St, which measures the particle's inertia, is less than 1/4. Here, we consider finitely dense particles, incorporating the previously neglected effects of added mass and the Boussinesq-Basset history force. Using linear stability analysis near stagnation points, we determine the critical parametric conditions in the St-R plane that leads to particle trapping within vortex cells. We identify additional stagnation points perceived by inertial particles, beyond the traditional ones at vortex cell corners, when the added mass effect is included, and we analyze their stability. Numerical analysis of the full nonlinear system confirms the existence of distinct particle behaviours--trapped, diffusive, and ballistic--depending on initial conditions, consistent with Nath et al. (2024), with modifications due to added mass effect. We delineate the regions in the St-R plane where these behaviours dominate based on the prominent particle dynamics. However, when both the history force and added mass effect are included, all particles exhibit ballistic motion regardless of St and R.",

AI-based approaches appear to be up to the challenge, but in production they must not only achieve high success rates. They must also ensure insertion quality and reliability. To address this, we introduce QBIT, a quality-aware benchmarking framework that incorporates additional metrics such as force energy, force smoothness and completion time to provide a comprehensive assessment. To ensure statistical significance and minimize the sim-to-real gap, we randomize contact parameters in the MuJoCo simulator, account for perceptual uncertainty, and conduct large-scale experiments on a Kubernetes-based infrastructure. Our microservice-oriented architecture ensures extensibility, broad applicability, and improved reproducibility. To facilitate seamless transitions to physical robotic testing, we use ROS2 with containerization to reduce integration barriers. We evaluate QBIT using three insertion approaches: geometricbased, force-based, and learning-based, in both simulated and real-world environments. In simulation, we compare the accuracy of contact simulation using different mesh decomposition techniques. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of QBIT in comparing different insertion approaches and accelerating the transition from laboratory to real-world applications.

        "summary": "Although large visual-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in multimodal tasks, errors may occasionally arise due to biases during the reasoning process. Recently, reward models (RMs) have become increasingly pivotal in the reasoning process. Specifically, process RMs evaluate each reasoning step, outcome RMs focus on the assessment of reasoning results, and critique RMs perform error analysis on the entire reasoning process, followed by corrections. However, existing benchmarks for vision-language RMs (VLRMs) typically assess only a single aspect of their capabilities (e.g., distinguishing between two answers), thus limiting the all-round evaluation and restricting the development of RMs in the visual-language domain. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark, dubbed as VLRMBench, encompassing 12,634 questions. VLRMBench is constructed based on three distinct types of datasets, covering mathematical reasoning, hallucination understanding, and multi-image understanding. We design 12 tasks across three major categories, focusing on evaluating VLRMs in the aspects of process understanding, outcome judgment, and critique generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on 21 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models, highlighting the challenges posed by VLRMBench. For instance, in the `Forecasting Future', a binary classification task, the advanced GPT-4o achieves only a 76.0% accuracy. Additionally, we perform comprehensive analytical studies, offering valuable insights for the future development of VLRMs. We anticipate that VLRMBench will serve as a pivotal benchmark in advancing VLRMs. Code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/JCruan519/VLRMBench.",

A. thaliana displays a range of responses to deal with Pi starvation, but special attention was paid to root hair elongation in this study. A central player in the root hair pathway is the transcription factor ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6-LIKE 4 (RSL4), which has been found to be upregulated during the Pi stress. A Petri Net was created which could simulate the gene regulatory networks responsible for the increase in root hair length, as well as the resulting increase in root hair length. Notably, discrepancies between the model and the literature suggested an important role for RSL2 in regulating RSL4. In the future, the net designed in the current study could be used as a platform to develop hypotheses about the interaction between RSL2 and RSL4.",

On the other hand, it often encounters the dilemma among anchor features, model size, and rendering quality - large anchor features lead to large 3D models and high-quality rendering whereas reducing anchor features degrades Gaussian attribute prediction which leads to clear artifacts in the rendered textures and geometries. We design SOGS, an anchor-based 3D-GS technique that introduces second-order anchors to achieve superior rendering quality and reduced anchor features and model size simultaneously. Specifically, SOGS incorporates covariance-based second-order statistics and correlation across feature dimensions to augment features within each anchor, compensating for the reduced feature size and improving rendering quality effectively. In addition, it introduces a selective gradient loss to enhance the optimization of scene textures and scene geometries, leading to high-quality rendering with small anchor features. Extensive experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks show that SOGS achieves superior rendering quality in novel view synthesis with clearly reduced model size.",

To this end, we propose an estimator of KL divergence which is based on the von Mises expansion. Our closeness test attains optimal parametric rates under smoothness assumptions.

The essential prerequisite to understanding the microscopic mechanisms of this complex electronic landscape is to unveil the configuration and symmetry of the charge-density wave order. As to now, little consensus has been made on what symmetry is broken. Herein, we clarify the microscopic structure and symmetry breaking of the CDW phase in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity. Our approach is based on extracting coherent phonon spectra induced by three-dimensional CDW and comparing them to calculated phonon frequencies via density-functional theory. The combination of these experimental results and calculations provides compelling evidence that the CDW structure of both compounds prevailing up to T$_{\\text{CDW}}$ is the 2 $\\times$ 2 $\\times$ 2 staggered inverse Star-of-David pattern with interlayer $\\pi$ phase shift, in which the six-fold rotational symmetry is broken.

This can potentially reduce the cost of Massive MIMO RUs, since ADCs are the most expensive electronics in the base-station radio chain. However, these recent works do not model the necessary decimation filters that exist in the signal path of these high sampling rate ADCs. We show in this short paper that because of the decimation filters, there can be introduction of cross-talks which can hinder the performance of these shared ADC interfaces.

Their monitoring is challenging and often confined to the radar networks of single countries. By exploiting kilometer-scale climate simulations, a first-of-its-kind characterization of supercell occurrence in Europe is derived for the current and a warmer climate. Despite previous notions of supercells being uncommon in Europe, the model shows ~700 supercells per convective season. Occurrence peaks are co-located with complex topography e.g. the Alps. The absolute frequency maximum lies along the southern Alps with minima over the oceans and flat areas. Contrasting a current-climate simulation with a pseudo-global-warming +3$^\\circ$C global warming scenario, the future climate simulation shows an average increase of supercell occurrence by 11 %. However, there is a spatial dipole of change with strong increases in supercell frequencies in central and eastern Europe and a decrease in frequency over the Iberian Peninsula and southwestern France.",

        "summary": "Object detection and segmentation are widely employed in computer vision applications, yet conventional models like YOLO series, while efficient and accurate, are limited by predefined categories, hindering adaptability in open scenarios. Recent open-set methods leverage text prompts, visual cues, or prompt-free paradigm to overcome this, but often compromise between performance and efficiency due to high computational demands or deployment complexity. In this work, we introduce YOLOE, which integrates detection and segmentation across diverse open prompt mechanisms within a single highly efficient model, achieving real-time seeing anything. For text prompts, we propose Re-parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) strategy. It refines pretrained textual embeddings via a re-parameterizable lightweight auxiliary network and enhances visual-textual alignment with zero inference and transferring overhead. For visual prompts, we present Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE). It employs decoupled semantic and activation branches to bring improved visual embedding and accuracy with minimal complexity. For prompt-free scenario, we introduce Lazy Region-Prompt Contrast (LRPC) strategy. It utilizes a built-in large vocabulary and specialized embedding to identify all objects, avoiding costly language model dependency. Extensive experiments show YOLOE's exceptional zero-shot performance and transferability with high inference efficiency and low training cost. Notably, on LVIS, with 3$\\times$ less training cost and 1.4$\\times$ inference speedup, YOLOE-v8-S surpasses YOLO-Worldv2-S by 3.5 AP. When transferring to COCO, YOLOE-v8-L achieves 0.6 AP$^b$ and 0.4 AP$^m$ gains over closed-set YOLOv8-L with nearly 4$\\times$ less training time.

        "summary": "While cryptographic algorithms such as the ubiquitous Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are secure, *physical implementations* of these algorithms in hardware inevitably 'leak' sensitive data such as cryptographic keys. A particularly insidious form of leakage arises from the fact that hardware consumes power and emits radiation in a manner that is statistically associated with the data it processes and the instructions it executes. Supervised deep learning has emerged as a state-of-the-art tool for carrying out *side-channel attacks*, which exploit this leakage by learning to map power/radiation measurements throughout encryption to the sensitive data operated on during that encryption. In this work we develop a principled deep learning framework for determining the relative leakage due to measurements recorded at different points in time, in order to inform *defense* against such attacks. This information is invaluable to cryptographic hardware designers for understanding *why* their hardware leaks and how they can mitigate it (e.g. by indicating the particular sections of code or electronic components which are responsible). Our framework is based on an adversarial game between a family of classifiers trained to estimate the conditional distributions of sensitive data given subsets of measurements, and a budget-constrained noise distribution which probabilistically erases individual measurements to maximize the loss of these classifiers. We demonstrate our method's efficacy and ability to overcome limitations of prior work through extensive experimental comparison with 8 baseline methods using 3 evaluation metrics and 6 publicly-available power/EM trace datasets from AES, ECC and RSA implementations. We provide an open-source PyTorch implementation of these experiments.",

Conventional fault detection methods depend on continuous, high-frequency vibration sensing, digitising, and wireless transmission to the cloud-an approach that significantly drains the limited energy reserves of battery-powered sensors, accelerating their depletion and increasing maintenance costs. This work proposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous vibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to specific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as the key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the machinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital conversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the sensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach, we use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets, examining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also consider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices, and the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested energy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and severities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a diagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance strategy for fault detection in smart machinery.",

We assume that the photovoltaic system is composed of a photovoltaic panel and a battery, where the photovoltaic panel produces energy according to a certain stochastic process. The management of the battery is the responsibility of a group administrator, who makes the joint decision to either store part of the photovoltaic energy production and sell the remaining energy at the electricity spot price, or discharge part of the energy stored in the battery and sell it in the electricity market. Inspired by European Union and Italian legislation, which promote incentives for energy transition and renewable energy production, we assume that the group receives a monetary incentive for the virtual self-consumed energy, defined as the minimum between the power bought from the grid to satisfy the group's power demand and the energy sold to the market. In this case, the energy sold by the group is a mix of part of the photovoltaic production that is not stored and part of the energy discharged from the battery. We model the problem as a stochastic optimal control problem, where the optimal strategy is the joint charge-discharge decision that minimizes the group's energy consumption costs. We find the solution numerically by applying a finite difference scheme to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the value function of the optimal control problem.",

Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints.

However conventional ITR systems typically only rely on global image or text representations for measuring patient image/report similarities, which overlook local distinctiveness across patient cases. This often results in suboptimal retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose an Anatomical Location-Conditioned Image-Text Retrieval (ALC-ITR) framework, which, given a query image and the associated suspicious anatomical region(s), aims to retrieve similar patient cases exhibiting the same disease or symptoms in the same anatomical region. To perform location-conditioned multimodal retrieval, we learn a medical Relevance-Region-Aligned Vision Language (RRA-VL) model with semantic global-level and region-/word-level alignment to produce generalizable, well-aligned multi-modal representations. Additionally, we perform location-conditioned contrastive learning to further utilize cross-pair region-level contrastiveness for improved multi-modal retrieval. We show that our proposed RRA-VL achieves state-of-the-art localization performance in phase-grounding tasks, and satisfying multi-modal retrieval performance with or without location conditioning. Finally, we thoroughly investigate the generalizability and explainability of our proposed ALC-ITR system in providing explanations and preliminary diagnosis reports given retrieved patient cases (conditioned on anatomical regions), with proper off-the-shelf LLM prompts.",

We show in addition, that the speed of propagation for this mode vanishes, indicating the presence of another type of strong coupling. To further investigate this, we extend our analysis to the Bianchi Type I Universe, with the most general solution for the vector field. We show that the extra degree of freedom remains in the theory. Among the modes, we further show that the mode with vanishing speed of propagation is still present, pointing to the strong coupling.

However, current understanding of algorithm design primitives for computationally efficient exploration with language models is limited. To better understand how to leverage access to powerful pre-trained generative models to improve the efficiency of exploration, we introduce a new computational framework for RL with language models, in which the learner interacts with the model through a sampling oracle. Focusing on the linear softmax model parameterization, we provide new results that reveal the computational-statistical tradeoffs of efficient exploration: 1. Necessity of coverage: Coverage refers to the extent to which the pre-trained model covers near-optimal responses -- a form of hidden knowledge. We show that coverage, while not necessary for data efficiency, lower bounds the runtime of any algorithm in our framework. 2. Inference-time exploration: We introduce a new algorithm, SpannerSampling, which obtains optimal data efficiency and is computationally efficient whenever the pre-trained model enjoys sufficient coverage, matching our lower bound. SpannerSampling leverages inference-time computation with the pre-trained model to reduce the effective search space for exploration. 3. Insufficiency of training-time interventions: We contrast the result above by showing that training-time interventions that produce proper policies cannot achieve similar guarantees in polynomial time. 4. Computational benefits of multi-turn exploration: Finally, we show that under additional representational assumptions, one can achieve improved runtime (replacing sequence-level coverage with token-level coverage) through multi-turn exploration.",

Therefore this paper presents a data-driven framework to approximate sea surface velocity from spatially distributed observations, thus enabling efficient probability advection modeling across submesoscale domains. The system approximates transient flows by leveraging quasi-steady flow assumptions. To overcome the limitations of point measurements in capturing domain-wide circulation, the method employs a fusion of two simplified 2D flow models to approximate submesoscale dynamics, enabling complete velocity field reconstruction from scattered data. To ensure reliable flow dynamics, the approach iteratively adjusts boundary conditions in numerical simulations to align the simulated flow with observations. Experimental validation in Kvarner Bay using GPS-tracked drifters confirmed the system's ability to replace computationally intensive transient simulations by approximating flow fields based on model simplifications. The results demonstrate its efficiency across domains, making it a practical tool for real-world submesoscale applications requiring swift passive scalar advection.",

Hence, this paper aimed to explore the interconnection between these two pathways. Using the Petri net modeling tool Snoopy, an established HIF network model was transformed to be a continuous Petri net.

Models based on the transformer architecture such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) have gained widespread popularity in various applications such as software development and education. The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Bard to the general public has showcased the tremendous potential of these models and encouraged their integration into various domains such as software development for tasks such as code generation, debugging, and documentation generation. In this study, opinions from 11 experts regarding their experience with LLMs for software development have been gathered and analysed to draw insights that can guide successful and responsible integration. The overall opinion of the experts is positive, with the experts identifying advantages such as increase in productivity and reduced coding time. Potential concerns and challenges such as risk of over-dependence and ethical considerations have also been highlighted.",

        "summary": "In the vicinity of the liquid--vapor critical point, supercritical fluids behave strongly compressibly and, in parallel, thermophysical properties have strong state dependence. These lead to various peculiar phenomena, one of which being the piston effect where a sudden heating induces a mechanical pulse. The coupling between thermal and mechanical processes, in the linear approximation, yields a non-trivially rich thermoacoustics. The numerous applications of supercritical fluids raise the need for reliable yet fast and efficient numerical solution for thermoacoustic time and space dependence in this sensitive domain. Here, we present a second-order accurate, fully explicit staggered space-time grid finite difference method for such coupled linear thermoacoustic problems. Time integration is based on the splitting of the state space vector field representing the interactions that affect the dynamics into reversible and irreversible parts, which splitting procedure leads to decoupled wave and heat equations. The former is a hyperbolic partial differential equation, while the latter is a parabolic one, therefore, different time integration algorithms must be amalgamated to obtain a reliable, dispersion error-free, and dissipation error-free numerical solution. Finally, the thermoacoustic approximation of the supercritical piston effect is investigated via the developed method.",

        "summary": "Majority dynamics is a process on a simple, undirected graph $G$ with an initial Red/Blue color for every vertex of $G$. Each day, each vertex updates its color following the majority among its neighbors, using its previous color for tie-breaking. The dynamics achieves \\textit{unanimity} if every vertex has the same color after finitely many days, and such color is said to \\textit{win}. When $G$ is a $G(n,p)$ random graph, L. Tran and Vu (2019) found a codition in terms of $p$ and the initial difference $2\\Delta$ beteween the sizes of the Red and Blue camps, such that unanimity is achieved with probability arbitrarily close to 1. They showed that if $p\\Delta^2 \\gg1 $, $p\\Delta \\geq 100$, and $p\\geq (1+\\varepsilon) n^{-1}\\log n$ for a positive constant $\\varepsilon$, then unanimity occurs with probability $1 - o(1)$. If $p$ is not extremely small, namely $p > \\log^{-1/16} n $, then Sah and Sawhney (2022) showed that the condition $p\\Delta^2 \\gg 1$ is sufficient. If $n^{-1}\\log^2 n \\ll p \\ll n^{-1/2}\\log^{1/4} n$, we show that $p^{3/2}\\Delta \\gg n^{-1/2}\\log n$ is enough. Since this condition holds if $p\\Delta \\geq 100$ for $p$ in this range, this is an improvement of Tran's and Vu's result. For the closely related problem of finding the optimal condition for $p$ to achieve unanimity when the initial coloring is chosen uniformly at random among all possible Red/Blue assignments, our result implies a new lower bound $p \\gg n^{-2/3}\\log^{2/3} n$, which improves upon the previous bound of $n^{-3/5}\\log n$ by Chakraborti, Kim, Lee and T.

Our approach enables instant initialization of Gaussian parameters for new images without requiring per-image optimization from scratch, dramatically accelerating convergence. EigenGS introduces a frequency-aware learning mechanism that encourages Gaussians to adapt to different scales, effectively modeling varied spatial frequencies and preventing artifacts in high-resolution reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EigenGS not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to direct 2D Gaussian fitting but also reduces necessary parameter count and training time. The results highlight EigenGS's effectiveness and generalization ability across images with varying resolutions and diverse categories, making Gaussian-based image representation both high-quality and viable for real-time applications.",

This limitation is particularly problematic in applications to science and engineering, as complex features can be critical for discovery and analysis. To address this, we introduce Split Component Embedding Registration (SpliCER), a novel architecture which splits the image into sections and distils information from each section to guide the model to learn more subtle and complex features without compromising on simpler features. SpliCER is compatible with any self-supervised loss function and can be integrated into existing methods without modification. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: i) we demonstrate that existing self-supervised methods can learn shortcut solutions when simple and complex features are both present; ii) we introduce a novel self-supervised training method, SpliCER, to overcome the limitations of existing methods, and achieve significant downstream performance improvements; iii) we demonstrate the effectiveness of SpliCER in cutting-edge medical and geospatial imaging settings. SpliCER offers a powerful new tool for representation learning, enabling models to uncover complex features which could be overlooked by other methods.",

The readout signal can generate non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which lead to excess microwave loss and decoherence. To understand this effect quantitatively, we measure quasiparticle fluctuations and extract the quasiparticle density across different temperatures, readout powers, and resonator volumes. We find that microwave power generates a higher quasiparticle density as the active resonator volume is reduced and show that this effect sets a sensitivity limit on kinetic inductance detectors. We compare our results with theoretical models of direct microwave photon absorption by quasiparticles and conclude that an unknown, indirect mechanism plays a dominant role in quasiparticle generation. These results provide a route to mitigate quasiparticle generation due to readout power in superconducting devices.",

By extracting the coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, we discover close phonon pairs near 1.3 THz and 3.1 THz, as well as a new mode at 1.84 THz. The 1.3 THz phonon pair and the 1.84 THz mode are observed up to the CDW transition temperature. Combining density-functional theory calculations, we point out these phonon pairs arise from the coexistence of Star-of-David and inverse Star-of-David distortions combined with six-fold rotational symmetry breaking. An anisotropy in the magnitude of transient reflectivity change is also revealed at the onset of CDW order. Our results thus indicate broken six-fold rotational symmetry in the charge-density wave state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, along with the absence of nematic fluctuation above T$_{\\text{CDW}}$. Meanwhile, the measured coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-\\text{x}}$Sn$_\\text{x}$ with x = 0.03-0.04 matches with staggered inverse Star-of-David with interlayer $\\pi$ phase shift. This CDW structure contrasts with undoped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and explains the evolution from phonon pair to a single mode at 1.3 THz by x = 0.03-0.04 Sn-doping.",

In perturbative methods, this involves the evaluation of higher order corrections to the leading order (LO) scattering amplitudes, including real emissions and loop corrections. Although experimental uncertainties today are larger than those of simulations, at the High Luminosity LHC experimental precision is expected to be above the theoretical one for events generated below next-to-leading order (NLO) precision. As forecasted hardware resources will not meet CPU requirements for these simulation needs, speeding up NLO event generation is a necessity. In recent years, collaborators across Europe and the United States have been working on CPU vectorisation of LO event generation within the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework, as well as porting it to GPUs, to major success. Recently, development has also started on vectorising NLO event generation. Due to the more complicated nature of NLO amplitudes this development faces several difficulties not accounted for in the LO development, but it shows promise. Here, we present these issues as well as the current status of our event-parallel NLO implementation.",

In low-quality sensor data regimes we employ a robustly contracting controller that is synthesized online by solving a sum-of-squares program based on data acquired in the high-quality regime, so as to limit state deviation until high-quality data is available. This approach is motivated by real-life control applications in which systems experience periodic data blackouts or occlusion, such as autonomous vehicles undergoing loss of GPS signal or solar glare in machine vision systems.

Here, we analyse the properties of ICL in the massive cluster Abell 2390 at redshift z=0.228. Our analysis is based on the deep images obtained by the Euclid mission as part of the Early Release Observations in the near-infrared (Y, J, H bands), using the NISP instrument in a 0.75 deg$^2$ field. We subtracted a point--spread function (PSF) model and removed the Galactic cirrus contribution in each band after modelling it with the DAWIS software. We then applied three methods to detect, characterise, and model the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the CICLE 2D multi-galaxy fitting; the DAWIS wavelet-based multiscale software; and a mask-based 1D profile fitting. We detect ICL out to 600 kpc. The ICL fractions derived by our three methods range between 18% and 36% (average of 24%), while the BCG+ICL fractions are between 21% and 41% (average of 29%), depending on the band and method. A galaxy density map based on 219 selected cluster members shows a strong cluster substructure to the south-east and a smaller feature to the north-west. Based on colours, the ICL (out to about 400 kpc) seems to be built by the accretion of small systems (M ~ $10^{9.5}$ solar mass), or from stars coming from the outskirts of Milky Way-type galaxies (M ~ $10^{10}$ solar mass). Though Abell 2390 does not seem to be undergoing a merger, it is not yet fully relaxed, since it has accreted two groups that have not fully merged with the cluster core. We estimate that the contributions to the inner 300 kpc of the ICL of the north-west and south-east subgroups are 21% and 9% respectively.",

In order to understand better the underlying mechanism of plant response to Pi, the response to phosphate starvation in Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated through use of Petri Nets, a formal language suitable for bio-modeling. A. thaliana displays a range of responses to deal with Pi starvation, but special attention was paid to root hair elongation in this study. A central player in the root hair pathway is the transcription factor ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6-LIKE 4 (RSL4), which has been found to be upregulated during the Pi stress. A Petri Net was created which could simulate the gene regulatory networks responsible for the increase in root hair length, as well as the resulting increase in root hair length. Notably, discrepancies between the model and the literature suggested an important role for RSL2 in regulating RSL4. In the future, the net designed in the current study could be used as a platform to develop hypotheses about the interaction between RSL2 and RSL4.",

This study presents an advanced evaluation of the developed open-source fabrication software Augmented Carpentry (AC), focusing on the technical challenges, potential bottlenecks, and precision of the proposed system, which is designed to recognize both objects and tools. In the workflow, computer vision tools and sensors implement inside-out tracking techniques for the retrofitting tools. This method enables operators to perform precise saw-cutting and drilling tasks using computer-generated feedback. In the design and manufacturing process pipeline, manual fabrication tasks are performed directly from the computer-aided design environment, as computer numerical control machines are widely used in the timber construction industry. Traditional non-digital methods employing execution drawings, markings, and jigs can now be replaced, and manual labor can be directly integrated into the digital value chain. First, this paper introduces the developed methodology and explains its devices and functional phases in detail. Second, the fabrication methodology is evaluated by experimentally scanning the produced one-to-one scale mock-up elements and comparing the discrepancies with their respective three-dimensional execution models. Finally, improvements and limitations in the tool-aware fabrication process, as well as the potential impact of AC in the digital timber fabrication landscape, are discussed.",

A major driving force behind this adoption is the benefits of digital up/down-conversion and improved digital filtering. Recent works have also advocated for utilizing this high sampling bandwidth to fit-in multiple MIMO streams, and reduce the number of ADCs required to build MIMO base-stations. This can potentially reduce the cost of Massive MIMO RUs, since ADCs are the most expensive electronics in the base-station radio chain. However, these recent works do not model the necessary decimation filters that exist in the signal path of these high sampling rate ADCs. We show in this short paper that because of the decimation filters, there can be introduction of cross-talks which can hinder the performance of these shared ADC interfaces. We simulate the shared ADC interface with Matlab 5G toolbox for uplink MIMO, and show that these cross-talks can be mitigated by performing MMSE equalization atop the PUSCH estimated channels.",

Despite previous notions of supercells being uncommon in Europe, the model shows ~700 supercells per convective season. Occurrence peaks are co-located with complex topography e.g. the Alps. The absolute frequency maximum lies along the southern Alps with minima over the oceans and flat areas. Contrasting a current-climate simulation with a pseudo-global-warming +3$^\\circ$C global warming scenario, the future climate simulation shows an average increase of supercell occurrence by 11 %.

Conventional fault detection methods depend on continuous, high-frequency vibration sensing, digitising, and wireless transmission to the cloud-an approach that significantly drains the limited energy reserves of battery-powered sensors, accelerating their depletion and increasing maintenance costs. This work proposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous vibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to specific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as the key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the machinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital conversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the sensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach, we use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets, examining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also consider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices, and the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested energy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and severities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a diagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance strategy for fault detection in smart machinery.",

To bridge this gap, we developed a series of micro-lessons to help K--8 children learn about digital privacy and security at school. We first conducted a formative study by interviewing elementary school teachers to identify the design needs for digital privacy and security lessons. We then developed micro-lessons -- multiple 15-20 minute activities designed to be easily inserted into the existing curriculum -- using a co-design approach with multiple rounds of developing and revising the micro-lessons in collaboration with teachers. Throughout the process, we conducted evaluation sessions where teachers implemented or reviewed the micro-lessons. Our study identifies strengths, challenges, and teachers' tailoring strategies when incorporating micro-lessons for K--8 digital privacy and security topics, providing design implications for facilitating learning about these topics in school classrooms.",

This concept is central to the development of a 6G architecture that aims to exploit the accelerated compute capabilities for supporting both real-time signal processing and offloading of Generative AI (GenAI) workloads. However, both the architectural framework required to support this vision and the dynamic resource allocation strategy are still in their infancy. The O-RAN architecture intrinsically allows cloud-native disaggregated implementation. Consequently, we explore a framework that can allow orchestration of AI-and-RAN workloads by expanding the Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (NRT-RIC) within O-RAN. The framework incorporates a monitoring xApp that tracks RAN KPIs and exposes radio analytics to the proposed E2E orchestrator via a recently introduced Y1 interface. The orchestrator implements a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically allocate critical computing resources, e.g., Multi-Instance GPUs (MIGs), between latency-sensitive RAN network functions and computationally intensive AI workloads on shared RAN infrastructure. The proposed framework provides insight on how the traditional RAN architecture can be evolved to inherently support emerging GenAI workloads. Our framework prioritizes the real-time requirements of RAN workloads while maintaining efficient resource sharing for AI applications. The simulation results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework, as it meets nearly 99% of the requests for RAN workload while effectively supporting AI workloads and achieving 100% utilization of the RAN infrastructure resources in a dynamic environment.",

This framework dynamically prioritizes critical obstacles and agents in the swarms vicinity using attention weights, while CBFs formally guarantee safety by enforcing collision-free constraints.

A central focus is the potential emergence of transformative AI (TAI), eventually capable of outperforming humans in all economically valuable tasks and fully automating labor. Discussed scenarios range from human extinction after a misaligned TAI takes over (\"AI doom\") to unprecedented economic growth and abundance (\"post-scarcity\"). However, the probabilities and implications of these scenarios remain highly uncertain. Here, we organize the various scenarios and evaluate their associated existential risks and economic outcomes in terms of aggregate welfare. Our analysis shows that even low-probability catastrophic outcomes justify large investments in AI safety and alignment research. We find that the optimizing representative individual would rationally allocate substantial resources to mitigate extinction risk; in some cases, she would prefer not to develop TAI at all. This result highlights that current global efforts in AI safety and alignment research are vastly insufficient relative to the scale and urgency of existential risks posed by TAI. Our findings therefore underscore the need for stronger safeguards to balance the potential economic benefits of TAI with the prevention of irreversible harm. Addressing these risks is crucial for steering technological progress toward sustainable human prosperity.",

To address these challenges, we present MovieAgent, an automated movie generation via multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) planning. MovieAgent offers two key advantages: 1) We firstly explore and define the paradigm of automated movie/long-video generation. Given a script and character bank, our MovieAgent can generates multi-scene, multi-shot long-form videos with a coherent narrative, while ensuring character consistency, synchronized subtitles, and stable audio throughout the film. 2) MovieAgent introduces a hierarchical CoT-based reasoning process to automatically structure scenes, camera settings, and cinematography, significantly reducing human effort. By employing multiple LLM agents to simulate the roles of a director, screenwriter, storyboard artist, and location manager, MovieAgent streamlines the production pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that MovieAgent achieves new state-of-the-art results in script faithfulness, character consistency, and narrative coherence. Our hierarchical framework takes a step forward and provides new insights into fully automated movie generation.

We develop a method to identify CSOs by combining Gaia optical astrometry with VLBI radio imaging. We analyze 40 CSO candidates by overlaying Gaia DR3 positions on VLBI maps to locate their central engines. CSOs are confirmed when Gaia positions lie between symmetric radio lobes, while core-jet sources show optical positions coinciding with one end of the radio structure. We verify classifications using spectral indices, variability, and jet kinematics from multi-epoch VLBI observations. Our method identified 22 genuine CSOs and 10 core-jet sources, with 8 objects remaining ambiguous. Confirmed CSOs show kinematic ages from 20 to over 1000 years and hotspot speeds typically below 0.5c. Five nearby CSOs show optical-radio offsets despite strong CSO morphology, indicating host galaxy influence. The Gaia-VLBI method provides a reliable CSO identification tool. Our sample reveals diverse radio powers, suggesting multiple evolutionary paths. CSO evolution appears influenced by both intrinsic jet power and environmental factors, with high-power CSOs potentially evolving into large-scale radio galaxies while low-power CSOs often show confinement by their host environments.",

Cybersecurity is oddly enough quite well understood in most jurisdictions worldwide. However, concept comprehension cannot enforce or create compliance, hence the need for good regulatory approaches. The comparative legal analysis of the EU and the US show that there are large differences in definitions and enforcement, but some concepts are repeated in both jurisdictions. These can be further refined to become derivable principles, which can be used to inspire legislation in any democratic jurisdiction. They are: Voluntary Cooperation, Adaptable Definitions, Strong-arm Authorities, Mandated Computer Emergency Response Teams, and Effective Sanctions.

The edge states spread towards the inner side of the islands over a width of 2-3 nm. The two edge-state peaks at positive and negative energies both move to higher values with increase of the magnetic field, and they disappear near the transition temperature $T_\\mathrm{c}$ of FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$. The edge states are interpreted as the counter-propagating topological edge states induced by the strong spin-orbit coupling effect of the Bi island, and the zero-energy mode emerges when the edge states touch each other in some small Bi islands. Meanwhile, enhanced superconducting gaps are observed in the central regions of these Bi islands, which may be induced by the enhanced pair potential of the topological surface state. Our observations provide useful message for the nontrivial topological superconductivity on specific Bi islands grown on FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$ substrate.",

This paper proposes XMutant, a technique that leverages explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to generate challenging test inputs. XMutant uses the local explanation of the input to inform the fuzz testing process and effectively guide it toward failures of the DL system under test. We evaluated different configurations of XMutant in triggering failures for different DL systems both for model-level (sentiment analysis, digit recognition) and system-level testing (advanced driving assistance). Our studies showed that XMutant enables more effective and efficient test generation by focusing on the most impactful parts of the input. XMutant generates up to 125% more failure-inducing inputs compared to an existing baseline, up to 7X faster. We also assessed the validity of these inputs, maintaining a validation rate above 89%, according to automated and human validators.",

As application we obtain a flexible and general condition yielding local bifurcations of specific bounded entire solutions to (Carath{\\'e}odory) differential equations. These bifurcations are intrinsically nonautonomous in the sense that the assumptions implying them cannot be fulfilled for autonomous or periodic temporal forcings. In addition, we demonstrate that Evans functions are strictly related to the dichotomy spectrum and hyperbolicity, which play a crucial role in studying the existence of bounded solutions on the whole real line and therefore the recent field of nonautonomous bifurcation theory.

However, this approach may still fail to fully preserve data privacy, as models from local clients are exposed to the central server during the aggregation process. This issue becomes even more critical when training vision-language models (VLMs) with FL, as VLMs can easily memorize training data instances, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs). To address this challenge, we propose the FedRand framework, which avoids disclosing the full set of client parameters. In this framework, each client randomly selects subparameters of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from the server and keeps the remaining counterparts of the LoRA weights as private parameters. After training both parameters on the client's private dataset, only the non-private client parameters are sent back to the server for aggregation. This approach mitigates the risk of exposing client-side VLM parameters, thereby enhancing data privacy. We empirically validate that FedRand improves robustness against MIAs compared to relevant baselines while achieving accuracy comparable to methods that communicate full LoRA parameters across several benchmark datasets.",

The phase shift is achieved by digitally controlling the relative delay between the periodic modulating sequences of the antennas. The practical use of this architecture is limited by two factors. First, the switching frequency is high, as it must be a multiple of the sampling frequency. Second, the discrete modulating sequence introduces undesired harmonic replicas of the signal with non-negligible power. In this paper, aliasing is exploited to simultaneously reduce sideband radiation and switching frequency. To facilitate coherent combining of aliased signal blocks, the transmit signal has a repeated block structure in the frequency domain. As a result, a factor $A$ reduction in switching frequency is achieved at the cost of a factor $A$ reduction in communication capacity. Doubling $A$ reduces sideband radiation by around 2.9 dB.",

Two prominent approaches in SSL include contrastive-based learning and self-distillation utilizing cropping augmentation. Lately, masked image modeling (MIM) has emerged as a more potent SSL technique, employing image inpainting as a pretext task. MIM creates a strong inductive bias toward meaningful spatial and semantic understanding. This has opened up new opportunities for SSL to contribute not only to classification tasks but also to more complex applications like object detection and image segmentation. Building upon this progress, our research paper introduces a scalable and practical SSL approach centered around more challenging pretext tasks that facilitate the acquisition of robust features. Specifically, we leverage multi-scale image reconstruction from randomly masked input images as the foundation for feature learning. Our hypothesis posits that reconstructing high-resolution images enables the model to attend to finer spatial details, particularly beneficial for discerning subtle intricacies within medical images.

The selected frequency offset between the antennas results in overlap and coherent summation of the differently precoded subcarrier blocks. This allows to achieve fully digital beamforming over a single block with the use of a single digital-to-analog converter.

Unlike the topological polar vortex and skyrmions observed in superlattices of (PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n and sliding bilayers of BN and MoS2, the underlying mechanism of polar domain formation in this system arises from stacking-dependent energy barriers for ferroelectric switching and variations in switching speeds under thermal perturbations. Notably, the thermal stability and polarization lifetimes are highly sensitive to twist angles and temperature, and can be further manipulated by external electric fields and strain. Through multi-scale simulations, our study provides a novel approach to exploring how twist angles influence domain evolution and underscores the potential for controlling local polarization in ferroelectric materials via rotational manipulation.",

However, there exist inherent variations between vision and language data, such as information density, i.e., images can contain textual information from multiple different views, which makes it difficult to compute the similarity between these two modalities accurately and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Asymmetric Visual Semantic Embedding (AVSE) to dynamically select features from various regions of images tailored to different textual inputs for similarity calculation. To capture information from different views in the image, we design a radial bias sampling module to sample image patches and obtain image features from various views, Furthermore, AVSE introduces a novel module for efficient computation of visual semantic similarity between asymmetric image and text embeddings. Central to this module is the presumption of foundational semantic units within the embeddings, denoted as ``meta-semantic embeddings.\" It segments all embeddings into meta-semantic embeddings with the same dimension and calculates visual semantic similarity by finding the optimal match of meta-semantic embeddings of two modalities. Our proposed AVSE model is extensively evaluated on the large-scale MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets, demonstrating its superiority over recent state-of-the-art methods.",

The core idea of LaTexBlend is to represent single concepts and blend multiple concepts within a Latent Textual space, which is positioned after the text encoder and a linear projection. LaTexBlend customizes each concept individually, storing them in a concept bank with a compact representation of latent textual features that captures sufficient concept information to ensure high fidelity. At inference, concepts from the bank can be freely and seamlessly combined in the latent textual space, offering two key merits for multi-concept generation: 1) excellent scalability, and 2) significant reduction of denoising deviation, preserving coherent layouts.

Falling is a frequent and critical problem for elderly people causing serious long-term health issues. Fall detection from video streams is not an attractive option for real-life applications due to privacy issues. Existing methods try to resolve this issue by using very low-resolution cameras or video encryption. However, privacy cannot be ensured completely with such approaches. Key points on the body, such as skeleton joints, can convey significant information about motion dynamics and successive posture changes which are crucial for fall detection. Skeleton joints have been explored for feature extraction but with image recognition models that ignore joint dependency across frames which is important for the classification of actions. Moreover, existing models are over-parameterized or evaluated on small datasets with very few activity classes. We propose an efficient graph convolution network model that exploits spatio-temporal joint dependencies and dynamics of human skeleton joints for accurate fall detection. Our method leverages dynamic representation with robust concurrent spatio-temporal characteristics of skeleton joints. We performed extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets. With a significantly smaller model size than most existing methods, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the large scale NTU datasets.",

Previous research found that poor representations and biased classifiers are the main problems and proposed neural-collapse-inspired synthetic simplex ETF to help representations be closer to neural collapse optima. However, we find that the neural-collapse-inspired methods are not strong enough to reach neural collapse and still have huge gaps to centralized training. In this paper, we rethink this issue from a self-bootstrap perspective and propose FedYoYo (You Are Your Own Best Teacher), introducing Augmented Self-bootstrap Distillation (ASD) to improve representation learning by distilling knowledge between weakly and strongly augmented local samples, without needing extra datasets or models. We further introduce Distribution-aware Logit Adjustment (DLA) to balance the self-bootstrap process and correct biased feature representations. FedYoYo nearly eliminates the performance gap, achieving centralized-level performance even under mixed heterogeneity. It enhances local representation learning, reducing model drift and improving convergence, with feature prototypes closer to neural collapse optimality. Extensive experiments show FedYoYo achieves state-of-the-art results, even surpassing centralized logit adjustment methods by 5.4\\% under global long-tailed settings.",

This paper addresses the distributed pose graph optimization (PGO) problem under non-convex constraints, with the goal of approximating the rotation and translation of each pose given relevant noisy measurements. To achieve this goal, the splitting method based on the concepts of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and Bregman iteration are applied to solve the rotation subproblems. The proposed approach enables the iterative resolution of constrained problems, achieved through solving unconstrained problems and orthogonality-constrained quadratic problems that have analytical solutions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against two practical methods in pose graph optimization: the Distributed Gauss-Seidel (DGS) algorithm and the centralized pose graph optimizer with an optimality certificate (SE-Sync). The efficiency of the proposed method is verified through its application to several simulated and real-world pose graph datasets.

Our dataset comprises 6,425 unique focus-aligned image pairs captured with smartphone sensors in dynamic settings under challenging lighting conditions (0.1--200 lux), covering various indoor and outdoor scenes with varying noise and intensity. We extracted and refined around 180,000 non-overlapping patches from 6,025 collected scenes for training while reserving 400 pairs for benchmarking. In addition to that, we collected 2,117 low-light scenes from different sources for extensive real-world aesthetic evaluation. To our knowledge, this is the largest real-world dataset available for SLLIE research. We also propose learning luminance-chrominance (LC) attributes separately through a tuning fork-shaped transformer model to enhance real-world low-light images, addressing challenges like denoising and over-enhancement in complex scenes.

This transition has a number of important consequences on financial instruments, OTC derivatives in particular. In this paper we show in detail how the switch from EONIA to ESTR affects the pricing of OIS, IRS and XVAs. We conclude that the adoption of the \"clean discounting\" approach recommended by the the ECB, based on ESTR only, is theoretically sound and leads to very limited impacts on financial valuations. This finding ensures the possibility, for the financial industry, to switch all EUR OTC derivatives, either cleared with Central Counterparties, or subject to bilateral collateral agreements, or non-collateralised, in a safe and consistent manner. The transition to such EONIA-free pricing framework is essential for the complete elimination of EONIA before its discontinuation scheduled on 31st December 2021.",

This study demonstrates a novel approach that uses simple bending strain gauges embedded inside a modular arm to extract complex information regarding its deformation and working conditions. The core idea is based on physical reservoir computing (PRC): A soft body's rich nonlinear dynamic responses, captured by the inter-connected bending sensor network, could be utilized for complex multi-modal sensing with a simple linear regression algorithm. Our results show that the soft modular arm reservoir can accurately predict body posture (bending angle), estimate payload weight, determine payload orientation, and even differentiate two payloads with only minimal difference in weight -- all using minimal digital computing power.",

Our sample comprises 538 AGN with strong [OIII]$\\lambda$5007 emission lines, of which 197 are detected in radio and 341 are radio-undetected. We analyzed [OIII]$\\lambda$5007 line in summed spectra, extracted over their central 500$\\times$500 pc$^2$ region. The calculated Balmer 4000 $\\AA$ break, D$_n$4000 is larger than 1.45 for $\\sim$95$\\%$ of the sources indicating that the specific star-formation rate in their central regions is smaller than 10$^{-11.5}$ yr$^{-1}$, pointing to evidence of negative AGN feedback suppressing star-formation. Considering the whole sample, radio-detected sources show an increased outflow detection rate (56$\\pm$7\\%) compared to radio-undetected sources (25$\\pm$3\\%). They also show higher velocity, mass outflow rate, outflow power and outflow momentum rate. We noticed a strong correlation between outflow characteristics and bolometric luminosity in both samples, except that the correlation is steeper for the radio-detected sample. Our findings suggest (a) warm ionized outflows are prevalent in all types of AGN, (b) radiation from AGN is the primary driver of these outflows, (c) radio jets are likely to play a secondary role in enhancing the gas kinematics over and above that caused by radiation, and (d) very low star-formation in the central regions of the galaxies, possibly due to negative feedback of AGN activity.",

It is shown that the optimal primal-dual point is a semiglobally exponentially stable equilibrium for the algorithm, which implies linear convergence. The analysis is based on the separation between a slow centralized optimization dynamics describing the evolution of the average estimate toward the optimum, and a fast dynamics describing the evolution of the consensus error over the network. These two dynamics are mutually coupled, and the stability analysis builds on control theoretic tools such as time-scale separation, Lyapunov theory, and the small-gain principle. Our analysis approach highlights that the consensus dynamics can be seen as a fast, parasite one, and that stability of the distributed algorithm is obtained as a robustness consequence of the semiglobal exponential stability properties of the centralized method. This perspective can be used to enable other significant extensions, such as time-varying networks or delayed communication, that can be seen as ``perturbations\" of the centralized algorithm.",

        "summary": "This paper critically examines the recent publication \"ChatGPT-4 in the Turing Test\" by Restrepo Echavarr\\'ia (2025), challenging its central claims regarding the absence of minimally serious test implementations and the conclusion that ChatGPT-4 fails the Turing Test. The analysis reveals that the criticisms based on rigid criteria and limited experimental data are not fully justified. More importantly, the paper makes several constructive contributions that enrich our understanding of Turing Test implementations. It demonstrates that two distinct formats--the three-player and two-player tests--are both valid, each with unique methodological implications. The work distinguishes between absolute criteria (reflecting an optimal 50% identification rate in a three-player format) and relative criteria (which measure how closely a machine's performance approximates that of a human), offering a more nuanced evaluation framework. Furthermore, the paper clarifies the probabilistic underpinnings of both test types by modeling them as Bernoulli experiments--correlated in the three-player version and uncorrelated in the two-player version. This formalization allows for a rigorous separation between the theoretical criteria for passing the test, defined in probabilistic terms, and the experimental data that require robust statistical methods for proper interpretation. In doing so, the paper not only refutes key aspects of the criticized study but also lays a solid foundation for future research on objective measures of how closely an AI's behavior aligns with, or deviates from, that of a human being.",

However, when creating digital corpora for less commonly written languages, it may be more appropriate to consider it a data mining problem. For these varieties, one knows ahead of time that the vast majority of documents are of little interest. By minimizing resources spent on classifying such documents, we can create corpora much faster and with better coverage than using established pipelines. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the language mining perspective, we introduce a new pipeline and corpora for several French-based Creoles.",

However, MLLMs usually perform poorly in zero-shot medical disease recognition, as they do not fully exploit the captured features and available medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LLaVA-RadZ, a simple yet effective framework for zero-shot medical disease recognition. Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities, which effectively utilizes image and text representations and facilitates robust cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. DKAM improves category-level alignment, allowing for accurate disease recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition and exhibits the state-of-the-art performance compared to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.",

So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of approximately -8 dB in the fundamental mode, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest recorded for pulsed squeezing. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links. This work completes the set of capabilities needed for robust multimode squeezed light detection and significantly expands its applicability in quantum technologies.",

        "summary": "Lane topology extraction involves detecting lanes and traffic elements and determining their relationships, a key perception task for mapless autonomous driving. This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by vision-language foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chain-of-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance. We evaluate the method on the OpenLane-V2 dataset, showing consistent improvements across various baseline detectors.

Here, we analyse the properties of ICL in the massive cluster Abell 2390 at redshift z=0.228. Our analysis is based on the deep images obtained by the Euclid mission as part of the Early Release Observations in the near-infrared (Y, J, H bands), using the NISP instrument in a 0.75 deg$^2$ field. We subtracted a point--spread function (PSF) model and removed the Galactic cirrus contribution in each band after modelling it with the DAWIS software. We then applied three methods to detect, characterise, and model the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the CICLE 2D multi-galaxy fitting; the DAWIS wavelet-based multiscale software; and a mask-based 1D profile fitting. We detect ICL out to 600 kpc. The ICL fractions derived by our three methods range between 18% and 36% (average of 24%), while the BCG+ICL fractions are between 21% and 41% (average of 29%), depending on the band and method. A galaxy density map based on 219 selected cluster members shows a strong cluster substructure to the south-east and a smaller feature to the north-west. Based on colours, the ICL (out to about 400 kpc) seems to be built by the accretion of small systems (M ~ $10^{9.5}$ solar mass), or from stars coming from the outskirts of Milky Way-type galaxies (M ~ $10^{10}$ solar mass). Though Abell 2390 does not seem to be undergoing a merger, it is not yet fully relaxed, since it has accreted two groups that have not fully merged with the cluster core. We estimate that the contributions to the inner 300 kpc of the ICL of the north-west and south-east subgroups are 21% and 9% respectively.",

Previous attacks often utilize multiple reference models to approximate the conditional score distribution, leading to significant computational overhead. While recent work leverages quantile regression to estimate conditional thresholds, it fails to capture epistemic uncertainty, resulting in bias in low-density regions. In this work, we propose a novel approach - Bayesian Membership Inference Attack (BMIA), which performs conditional attack through Bayesian inference. In particular, we transform a trained reference model into Bayesian neural networks by Laplace approximation, enabling the direct estimation of the conditional score distribution by probabilistic model parameters. Our method addresses both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty with only a reference model, enabling efficient and powerful MIA. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of BMIA.",

Our approach incorporates an active data generation strategy to maximize the utility of the generated motions, along with a local feature alignment mechanism that transfers natural movement patterns from walking data to enhance both the success rate and naturalness of the synthesized motions.

Using linear stability analysis near stagnation points, we determine the critical parametric conditions in the St-R plane that leads to particle trapping within vortex cells. We identify additional stagnation points perceived by inertial particles, beyond the traditional ones at vortex cell corners, when the added mass effect is included, and we analyze their stability. Numerical analysis of the full nonlinear system confirms the existence of distinct particle behaviours--trapped, diffusive, and ballistic--depending on initial conditions, consistent with Nath et al. (2024), with modifications due to added mass effect. We delineate the regions in the St-R plane where these behaviours dominate based on the prominent particle dynamics. However, when both the history force and added mass effect are included, all particles exhibit ballistic motion regardless of St and R.",

AI-based approaches appear to be up to the challenge, but in production they must not only achieve high success rates. They must also ensure insertion quality and reliability. To address this, we introduce QBIT, a quality-aware benchmarking framework that incorporates additional metrics such as force energy, force smoothness and completion time to provide a comprehensive assessment. To ensure statistical significance and minimize the sim-to-real gap, we randomize contact parameters in the MuJoCo simulator, account for perceptual uncertainty, and conduct large-scale experiments on a Kubernetes-based infrastructure. Our microservice-oriented architecture ensures extensibility, broad applicability, and improved reproducibility. To facilitate seamless transitions to physical robotic testing, we use ROS2 with containerization to reduce integration barriers. We evaluate QBIT using three insertion approaches: geometricbased, force-based, and learning-based, in both simulated and real-world environments. In simulation, we compare the accuracy of contact simulation using different mesh decomposition techniques. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of QBIT in comparing different insertion approaches and accelerating the transition from laboratory to real-world applications.

        "summary": "Although large visual-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in multimodal tasks, errors may occasionally arise due to biases during the reasoning process. Recently, reward models (RMs) have become increasingly pivotal in the reasoning process. Specifically, process RMs evaluate each reasoning step, outcome RMs focus on the assessment of reasoning results, and critique RMs perform error analysis on the entire reasoning process, followed by corrections. However, existing benchmarks for vision-language RMs (VLRMs) typically assess only a single aspect of their capabilities (e.g., distinguishing between two answers), thus limiting the all-round evaluation and restricting the development of RMs in the visual-language domain. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark, dubbed as VLRMBench, encompassing 12,634 questions. VLRMBench is constructed based on three distinct types of datasets, covering mathematical reasoning, hallucination understanding, and multi-image understanding. We design 12 tasks across three major categories, focusing on evaluating VLRMs in the aspects of process understanding, outcome judgment, and critique generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on 21 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models, highlighting the challenges posed by VLRMBench. For instance, in the `Forecasting Future', a binary classification task, the advanced GPT-4o achieves only a 76.0% accuracy. Additionally, we perform comprehensive analytical studies, offering valuable insights for the future development of VLRMs. We anticipate that VLRMBench will serve as a pivotal benchmark in advancing VLRMs. Code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/JCruan519/VLRMBench.",

A. thaliana displays a range of responses to deal with Pi starvation, but special attention was paid to root hair elongation in this study. A central player in the root hair pathway is the transcription factor ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6-LIKE 4 (RSL4), which has been found to be upregulated during the Pi stress. A Petri Net was created which could simulate the gene regulatory networks responsible for the increase in root hair length, as well as the resulting increase in root hair length. Notably, discrepancies between the model and the literature suggested an important role for RSL2 in regulating RSL4. In the future, the net designed in the current study could be used as a platform to develop hypotheses about the interaction between RSL2 and RSL4.",

On the other hand, it often encounters the dilemma among anchor features, model size, and rendering quality - large anchor features lead to large 3D models and high-quality rendering whereas reducing anchor features degrades Gaussian attribute prediction which leads to clear artifacts in the rendered textures and geometries. We design SOGS, an anchor-based 3D-GS technique that introduces second-order anchors to achieve superior rendering quality and reduced anchor features and model size simultaneously. Specifically, SOGS incorporates covariance-based second-order statistics and correlation across feature dimensions to augment features within each anchor, compensating for the reduced feature size and improving rendering quality effectively. In addition, it introduces a selective gradient loss to enhance the optimization of scene textures and scene geometries, leading to high-quality rendering with small anchor features. Extensive experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks show that SOGS achieves superior rendering quality in novel view synthesis with clearly reduced model size.",

The essential prerequisite to understanding the microscopic mechanisms of this complex electronic landscape is to unveil the configuration and symmetry of the charge-density wave order. As to now, little consensus has been made on what symmetry is broken. Herein, we clarify the microscopic structure and symmetry breaking of the CDW phase in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity. Our approach is based on extracting coherent phonon spectra induced by three-dimensional CDW and comparing them to calculated phonon frequencies via density-functional theory. The combination of these experimental results and calculations provides compelling evidence that the CDW structure of both compounds prevailing up to T$_{\\text{CDW}}$ is the 2 $\\times$ 2 $\\times$ 2 staggered inverse Star-of-David pattern with interlayer $\\pi$ phase shift, in which the six-fold rotational symmetry is broken.

This study presents an advanced evaluation of the developed open-source fabrication software Augmented Carpentry (AC), focusing on the technical challenges, potential bottlenecks, and precision of the proposed system, which is designed to recognize both objects and tools. In the workflow, computer vision tools and sensors implement inside-out tracking techniques for the retrofitting tools. This method enables operators to perform precise saw-cutting and drilling tasks using computer-generated feedback. In the design and manufacturing process pipeline, manual fabrication tasks are performed directly from the computer-aided design environment, as computer numerical control machines are widely used in the timber construction industry. Traditional non-digital methods employing execution drawings, markings, and jigs can now be replaced, and manual labor can be directly integrated into the digital value chain. First, this paper introduces the developed methodology and explains its devices and functional phases in detail. Second, the fabrication methodology is evaluated by experimentally scanning the produced one-to-one scale mock-up elements and comparing the discrepancies with their respective three-dimensional execution models.

This can potentially reduce the cost of Massive MIMO RUs, since ADCs are the most expensive electronics in the base-station radio chain. However, these recent works do not model the necessary decimation filters that exist in the signal path of these high sampling rate ADCs. We show in this short paper that because of the decimation filters, there can be introduction of cross-talks which can hinder the performance of these shared ADC interfaces. We simulate the shared ADC interface with Matlab 5G toolbox for uplink MIMO, and show that these cross-talks can be mitigated by performing MMSE equalization atop the PUSCH estimated channels.",

Recent open-set methods leverage text prompts, visual cues, or prompt-free paradigm to overcome this, but often compromise between performance and efficiency due to high computational demands or deployment complexity. In this work, we introduce YOLOE, which integrates detection and segmentation across diverse open prompt mechanisms within a single highly efficient model, achieving real-time seeing anything. For text prompts, we propose Re-parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) strategy. It refines pretrained textual embeddings via a re-parameterizable lightweight auxiliary network and enhances visual-textual alignment with zero inference and transferring overhead. For visual prompts, we present Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE). It employs decoupled semantic and activation branches to bring improved visual embedding and accuracy with minimal complexity. For prompt-free scenario, we introduce Lazy Region-Prompt Contrast (LRPC) strategy. It utilizes a built-in large vocabulary and specialized embedding to identify all objects, avoiding costly language model dependency.

        "summary": "While cryptographic algorithms such as the ubiquitous Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are secure, *physical implementations* of these algorithms in hardware inevitably 'leak' sensitive data such as cryptographic keys. A particularly insidious form of leakage arises from the fact that hardware consumes power and emits radiation in a manner that is statistically associated with the data it processes and the instructions it executes. Supervised deep learning has emerged as a state-of-the-art tool for carrying out *side-channel attacks*, which exploit this leakage by learning to map power/radiation measurements throughout encryption to the sensitive data operated on during that encryption. In this work we develop a principled deep learning framework for determining the relative leakage due to measurements recorded at different points in time, in order to inform *defense* against such attacks. This information is invaluable to cryptographic hardware designers for understanding *why* their hardware leaks and how they can mitigate it (e.g. by indicating the particular sections of code or electronic components which are responsible). Our framework is based on an adversarial game between a family of classifiers trained to estimate the conditional distributions of sensitive data given subsets of measurements, and a budget-constrained noise distribution which probabilistically erases individual measurements to maximize the loss of these classifiers. We demonstrate our method's efficacy and ability to overcome limitations of prior work through extensive experimental comparison with 8 baseline methods using 3 evaluation metrics and 6 publicly-available power/EM trace datasets from AES, ECC and RSA implementations. We provide an open-source PyTorch implementation of these experiments.",

However, personalizing extensive textual materials, such as narratives and academic textbooks, remains challenging due to their heavy use, which can hinder learner engagement and understanding. Building on cognitive theories like Dual Coding Theory -- which posits that combining textual and visual information enhances comprehension and memory -- this study explores the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) to enrich educational materials. We utilized large language models (LLMs) to generate concise text summaries and image generation models (IGMs) to create visually aligned content from textual inputs. After recruiting 24 participants, we verified that integrating AI-generated supplementary materials significantly improved learning outcomes, increasing post-reading test scores by 7.50%. These findings underscore GenAI's transformative potential in creating adaptive learning environments that enhance cognitive augmentation.",

Conventional fault detection methods depend on continuous, high-frequency vibration sensing, digitising, and wireless transmission to the cloud-an approach that significantly drains the limited energy reserves of battery-powered sensors, accelerating their depletion and increasing maintenance costs. This work proposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous vibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to specific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as the key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the machinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital conversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the sensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach, we use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets, examining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also consider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices, and the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested energy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and severities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a diagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance strategy for fault detection in smart machinery.",

We assume that the photovoltaic system is composed of a photovoltaic panel and a battery, where the photovoltaic panel produces energy according to a certain stochastic process. The management of the battery is the responsibility of a group administrator, who makes the joint decision to either store part of the photovoltaic energy production and sell the remaining energy at the electricity spot price, or discharge part of the energy stored in the battery and sell it in the electricity market. Inspired by European Union and Italian legislation, which promote incentives for energy transition and renewable energy production, we assume that the group receives a monetary incentive for the virtual self-consumed energy, defined as the minimum between the power bought from the grid to satisfy the group's power demand and the energy sold to the market. In this case, the energy sold by the group is a mix of part of the photovoltaic production that is not stored and part of the energy discharged from the battery. We model the problem as a stochastic optimal control problem, where the optimal strategy is the joint charge-discharge decision that minimizes the group's energy consumption costs. We find the solution numerically by applying a finite difference scheme to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the value function of the optimal control problem.",

Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints.

However conventional ITR systems typically only rely on global image or text representations for measuring patient image/report similarities, which overlook local distinctiveness across patient cases. This often results in suboptimal retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose an Anatomical Location-Conditioned Image-Text Retrieval (ALC-ITR) framework, which, given a query image and the associated suspicious anatomical region(s), aims to retrieve similar patient cases exhibiting the same disease or symptoms in the same anatomical region. To perform location-conditioned multimodal retrieval, we learn a medical Relevance-Region-Aligned Vision Language (RRA-VL) model with semantic global-level and region-/word-level alignment to produce generalizable, well-aligned multi-modal representations. Additionally, we perform location-conditioned contrastive learning to further utilize cross-pair region-level contrastiveness for improved multi-modal retrieval. We show that our proposed RRA-VL achieves state-of-the-art localization performance in phase-grounding tasks, and satisfying multi-modal retrieval performance with or without location conditioning. Finally, we thoroughly investigate the generalizability and explainability of our proposed ALC-ITR system in providing explanations and preliminary diagnosis reports given retrieved patient cases (conditioned on anatomical regions), with proper off-the-shelf LLM prompts.",

Via a perturbative approach, we quantify the cross-talk errors from transverse residual couplings and show that they scale as $nm^2$ where $n$ is the number of idle qubits and $m$ is the ratio between the transverse residual and active couplings. Setting an error threshold $E_\\mathrm{thr}$, we demonstrate that cross-talks restrict the hardware topology and prevent the full use of all-to-all connectivity.

We show in addition, that the speed of propagation for this mode vanishes, indicating the presence of another type of strong coupling. To further investigate this, we extend our analysis to the Bianchi Type I Universe, with the most general solution for the vector field. We show that the extra degree of freedom remains in the theory. Among the modes, we further show that the mode with vanishing speed of propagation is still present, pointing to the strong coupling.

However, current understanding of algorithm design primitives for computationally efficient exploration with language models is limited. To better understand how to leverage access to powerful pre-trained generative models to improve the efficiency of exploration, we introduce a new computational framework for RL with language models, in which the learner interacts with the model through a sampling oracle. Focusing on the linear softmax model parameterization, we provide new results that reveal the computational-statistical tradeoffs of efficient exploration: 1. Necessity of coverage: Coverage refers to the extent to which the pre-trained model covers near-optimal responses -- a form of hidden knowledge. We show that coverage, while not necessary for data efficiency, lower bounds the runtime of any algorithm in our framework. 2. Inference-time exploration: We introduce a new algorithm, SpannerSampling, which obtains optimal data efficiency and is computationally efficient whenever the pre-trained model enjoys sufficient coverage, matching our lower bound. SpannerSampling leverages inference-time computation with the pre-trained model to reduce the effective search space for exploration. 3. Insufficiency of training-time interventions: We contrast the result above by showing that training-time interventions that produce proper policies cannot achieve similar guarantees in polynomial time. 4. Computational benefits of multi-turn exploration: Finally, we show that under additional representational assumptions, one can achieve improved runtime (replacing sequence-level coverage with token-level coverage) through multi-turn exploration.",

However, obtaining an accurate approximation of these advection processes is challenging, even with modern measuring equipment, such as high-frequency radar or advanced simulations based on oceanic flow models. Therefore this paper presents a data-driven framework to approximate sea surface velocity from spatially distributed observations, thus enabling efficient probability advection modeling across submesoscale domains. The system approximates transient flows by leveraging quasi-steady flow assumptions. To overcome the limitations of point measurements in capturing domain-wide circulation, the method employs a fusion of two simplified 2D flow models to approximate submesoscale dynamics, enabling complete velocity field reconstruction from scattered data. To ensure reliable flow dynamics, the approach iteratively adjusts boundary conditions in numerical simulations to align the simulated flow with observations. Experimental validation in Kvarner Bay using GPS-tracked drifters confirmed the system's ability to replace computationally intensive transient simulations by approximating flow fields based on model simplifications. The results demonstrate its efficiency across domains, making it a practical tool for real-world submesoscale applications requiring swift passive scalar advection.",

These lead to various peculiar phenomena, one of which being the piston effect where a sudden heating induces a mechanical pulse. The coupling between thermal and mechanical processes, in the linear approximation, yields a non-trivially rich thermoacoustics. The numerous applications of supercritical fluids raise the need for reliable yet fast and efficient numerical solution for thermoacoustic time and space dependence in this sensitive domain. Here, we present a second-order accurate, fully explicit staggered space-time grid finite difference method for such coupled linear thermoacoustic problems. Time integration is based on the splitting of the state space vector field representing the interactions that affect the dynamics into reversible and irreversible parts, which splitting procedure leads to decoupled wave and heat equations. The former is a hyperbolic partial differential equation, while the latter is a parabolic one, therefore, different time integration algorithms must be amalgamated to obtain a reliable, dispersion error-free, and dissipation error-free numerical solution. Finally, the thermoacoustic approximation of the supercritical piston effect is investigated via the developed method.",

The dynamics achieves \\textit{unanimity} if every vertex has the same color after finitely many days, and such color is said to \\textit{win}. When $G$ is a $G(n,p)$ random graph, L. Tran and Vu (2019) found a codition in terms of $p$ and the initial difference $2\\Delta$ beteween the sizes of the Red and Blue camps, such that unanimity is achieved with probability arbitrarily close to 1. They showed that if $p\\Delta^2 \\gg1 $, $p\\Delta \\geq 100$, and $p\\geq (1+\\varepsilon) n^{-1}\\log n$ for a positive constant $\\varepsilon$, then unanimity occurs with probability $1 - o(1)$. If $p$ is not extremely small, namely $p > \\log^{-1/16} n $, then Sah and Sawhney (2022) showed that the condition $p\\Delta^2 \\gg 1$ is sufficient. If $n^{-1}\\log^2 n \\ll p \\ll n^{-1/2}\\log^{1/4} n$, we show that $p^{3/2}\\Delta \\gg n^{-1/2}\\log n$ is enough. Since this condition holds if $p\\Delta \\geq 100$ for $p$ in this range, this is an improvement of Tran's and Vu's result. For the closely related problem of finding the optimal condition for $p$ to achieve unanimity when the initial coloring is chosen uniformly at random among all possible Red/Blue assignments, our result implies a new lower bound $p \\gg n^{-2/3}\\log^{2/3} n$, which improves upon the previous bound of $n^{-3/5}\\log n$ by Chakraborti, Kim, Lee and T.

We present EigenGS, a novel method that bridges these paradigms through an efficient transformation pipeline connecting eigenspace and image-space Gaussian representations. Our approach enables instant initialization of Gaussian parameters for new images without requiring per-image optimization from scratch, dramatically accelerating convergence. EigenGS introduces a frequency-aware learning mechanism that encourages Gaussians to adapt to different scales, effectively modeling varied spatial frequencies and preventing artifacts in high-resolution reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EigenGS not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to direct 2D Gaussian fitting but also reduces necessary parameter count and training time. The results highlight EigenGS's effectiveness and generalization ability across images with varying resolutions and diverse categories, making Gaussian-based image representation both high-quality and viable for real-time applications.",

This limitation is particularly problematic in applications to science and engineering, as complex features can be critical for discovery and analysis. To address this, we introduce Split Component Embedding Registration (SpliCER), a novel architecture which splits the image into sections and distils information from each section to guide the model to learn more subtle and complex features without compromising on simpler features. SpliCER is compatible with any self-supervised loss function and can be integrated into existing methods without modification. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: i) we demonstrate that existing self-supervised methods can learn shortcut solutions when simple and complex features are both present; ii) we introduce a novel self-supervised training method, SpliCER, to overcome the limitations of existing methods, and achieve significant downstream performance improvements; iii) we demonstrate the effectiveness of SpliCER in cutting-edge medical and geospatial imaging settings. SpliCER offers a powerful new tool for representation learning, enabling models to uncover complex features which could be overlooked by other methods.",

The readout signal can generate non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which lead to excess microwave loss and decoherence. To understand this effect quantitatively, we measure quasiparticle fluctuations and extract the quasiparticle density across different temperatures, readout powers, and resonator volumes. We find that microwave power generates a higher quasiparticle density as the active resonator volume is reduced and show that this effect sets a sensitivity limit on kinetic inductance detectors. We compare our results with theoretical models of direct microwave photon absorption by quasiparticles and conclude that an unknown, indirect mechanism plays a dominant role in quasiparticle generation. These results provide a route to mitigate quasiparticle generation due to readout power in superconducting devices.",

By extracting the coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, we discover close phonon pairs near 1.3 THz and 3.1 THz, as well as a new mode at 1.84 THz. The 1.3 THz phonon pair and the 1.84 THz mode are observed up to the CDW transition temperature. Combining density-functional theory calculations, we point out these phonon pairs arise from the coexistence of Star-of-David and inverse Star-of-David distortions combined with six-fold rotational symmetry breaking. An anisotropy in the magnitude of transient reflectivity change is also revealed at the onset of CDW order. Our results thus indicate broken six-fold rotational symmetry in the charge-density wave state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, along with the absence of nematic fluctuation above T$_{\\text{CDW}}$. Meanwhile, the measured coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-\\text{x}}$Sn$_\\text{x}$ with x = 0.03-0.04 matches with staggered inverse Star-of-David with interlayer $\\pi$ phase shift. This CDW structure contrasts with undoped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and explains the evolution from phonon pair to a single mode at 1.3 THz by x = 0.03-0.04 Sn-doping.",

In perturbative methods, this involves the evaluation of higher order corrections to the leading order (LO) scattering amplitudes, including real emissions and loop corrections. Although experimental uncertainties today are larger than those of simulations, at the High Luminosity LHC experimental precision is expected to be above the theoretical one for events generated below next-to-leading order (NLO) precision. As forecasted hardware resources will not meet CPU requirements for these simulation needs, speeding up NLO event generation is a necessity. In recent years, collaborators across Europe and the United States have been working on CPU vectorisation of LO event generation within the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework, as well as porting it to GPUs, to major success. Recently, development has also started on vectorising NLO event generation. Due to the more complicated nature of NLO amplitudes this development faces several difficulties not accounted for in the LO development, but it shows promise. Here, we present these issues as well as the current status of our event-parallel NLO implementation.",

In the high-quality sensor data regime, we focus on robust system identification based on the data informativity framework. In low-quality sensor data regimes we employ a robustly contracting controller that is synthesized online by solving a sum-of-squares program based on data acquired in the high-quality regime, so as to limit state deviation until high-quality data is available. This approach is motivated by real-life control applications in which systems experience periodic data blackouts or occlusion, such as autonomous vehicles undergoing loss of GPS signal or solar glare in machine vision systems.

Eva leverages reservation price from economics to derive the optimal set of instances to provision and task-to-instance assignments. Eva also takes into account performance degradation when co-locating tasks and quantitatively evaluates the trade-off between short-term migration overhead and long-term provision savings when considering a change in cluster configuration. Experiments on AWS EC2 and large-scale trace-driven simulations demonstrate that Eva reduces costs by 42\\% while incurring only a 15\\% increase in JCT, compared to provisioning a separate instance for each task.",

Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities, which effectively utilizes image and text representations and facilitates robust cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. DKAM improves category-level alignment, allowing for accurate disease recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition and exhibits the state-of-the-art performance compared to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.",

So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of approximately -8 dB in the fundamental mode, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest recorded for pulsed squeezing. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links.

This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by vision-language foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chain-of-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance. We evaluate the method on the OpenLane-V2 dataset, showing consistent improvements across various baseline detectors.

Here, we analyse the properties of ICL in the massive cluster Abell 2390 at redshift z=0.228. Our analysis is based on the deep images obtained by the Euclid mission as part of the Early Release Observations in the near-infrared (Y, J, H bands), using the NISP instrument in a 0.75 deg$^2$ field. We subtracted a point--spread function (PSF) model and removed the Galactic cirrus contribution in each band after modelling it with the DAWIS software. We then applied three methods to detect, characterise, and model the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the CICLE 2D multi-galaxy fitting; the DAWIS wavelet-based multiscale software; and a mask-based 1D profile fitting. We detect ICL out to 600 kpc. The ICL fractions derived by our three methods range between 18% and 36% (average of 24%), while the BCG+ICL fractions are between 21% and 41% (average of 29%), depending on the band and method. A galaxy density map based on 219 selected cluster members shows a strong cluster substructure to the south-east and a smaller feature to the north-west. Based on colours, the ICL (out to about 400 kpc) seems to be built by the accretion of small systems (M ~ $10^{9.5}$ solar mass), or from stars coming from the outskirts of Milky Way-type galaxies (M ~ $10^{10}$ solar mass). Though Abell 2390 does not seem to be undergoing a merger, it is not yet fully relaxed, since it has accreted two groups that have not fully merged with the cluster core. We estimate that the contributions to the inner 300 kpc of the ICL of the north-west and south-east subgroups are 21% and 9% respectively.",

Previous attacks often utilize multiple reference models to approximate the conditional score distribution, leading to significant computational overhead. While recent work leverages quantile regression to estimate conditional thresholds, it fails to capture epistemic uncertainty, resulting in bias in low-density regions. In this work, we propose a novel approach - Bayesian Membership Inference Attack (BMIA), which performs conditional attack through Bayesian inference. In particular, we transform a trained reference model into Bayesian neural networks by Laplace approximation, enabling the direct estimation of the conditional score distribution by probabilistic model parameters. Our method addresses both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty with only a reference model, enabling efficient and powerful MIA. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of BMIA.",

Base on the observation that walking data captures valuable movement patterns transferable across tasks and, on the other hand, the advanced kinematic methods can generate diverse grasping poses, which can then be interpolated into motions to serve as task-specific guidance. Our approach incorporates an active data generation strategy to maximize the utility of the generated motions, along with a local feature alignment mechanism that transfers natural movement patterns from walking data to enhance both the success rate and naturalness of the synthesized motions. By combining the fidelity and stability of natural walking with the flexibility and generalizability of task-specific generated data, our method demonstrates strong performance and robust adaptability in diverse scenes and with unseen objects.",

A classic study by Taylor (2022) showed that heavy inertial point particles (having density parameter R = 1) are trapped by the flow separatrices when the particle Stokes number St, which measures the particle's inertia, is less than 1/4. Here, we consider finitely dense particles, incorporating the previously neglected effects of added mass and the Boussinesq-Basset history force. Using linear stability analysis near stagnation points, we determine the critical parametric conditions in the St-R plane that leads to particle trapping within vortex cells. We identify additional stagnation points perceived by inertial particles, beyond the traditional ones at vortex cell corners, when the added mass effect is included, and we analyze their stability. Numerical analysis of the full nonlinear system confirms the existence of distinct particle behaviours--trapped, diffusive, and ballistic--depending on initial conditions, consistent with Nath et al. (2024), with modifications due to added mass effect. We delineate the regions in the St-R plane where these behaviours dominate based on the prominent particle dynamics. However, when both the history force and added mass effect are included, all particles exhibit ballistic motion regardless of St and R.",

AI-based approaches appear to be up to the challenge, but in production they must not only achieve high success rates. They must also ensure insertion quality and reliability. To address this, we introduce QBIT, a quality-aware benchmarking framework that incorporates additional metrics such as force energy, force smoothness and completion time to provide a comprehensive assessment. To ensure statistical significance and minimize the sim-to-real gap, we randomize contact parameters in the MuJoCo simulator, account for perceptual uncertainty, and conduct large-scale experiments on a Kubernetes-based infrastructure. Our microservice-oriented architecture ensures extensibility, broad applicability, and improved reproducibility. To facilitate seamless transitions to physical robotic testing, we use ROS2 with containerization to reduce integration barriers. We evaluate QBIT using three insertion approaches: geometricbased, force-based, and learning-based, in both simulated and real-world environments. In simulation, we compare the accuracy of contact simulation using different mesh decomposition techniques. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of QBIT in comparing different insertion approaches and accelerating the transition from laboratory to real-world applications.

        "summary": "Although large visual-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in multimodal tasks, errors may occasionally arise due to biases during the reasoning process. Recently, reward models (RMs) have become increasingly pivotal in the reasoning process. Specifically, process RMs evaluate each reasoning step, outcome RMs focus on the assessment of reasoning results, and critique RMs perform error analysis on the entire reasoning process, followed by corrections. However, existing benchmarks for vision-language RMs (VLRMs) typically assess only a single aspect of their capabilities (e.g., distinguishing between two answers), thus limiting the all-round evaluation and restricting the development of RMs in the visual-language domain. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark, dubbed as VLRMBench, encompassing 12,634 questions. VLRMBench is constructed based on three distinct types of datasets, covering mathematical reasoning, hallucination understanding, and multi-image understanding. We design 12 tasks across three major categories, focusing on evaluating VLRMs in the aspects of process understanding, outcome judgment, and critique generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on 21 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models, highlighting the challenges posed by VLRMBench. For instance, in the `Forecasting Future', a binary classification task, the advanced GPT-4o achieves only a 76.0% accuracy. Additionally, we perform comprehensive analytical studies, offering valuable insights for the future development of VLRMs. We anticipate that VLRMBench will serve as a pivotal benchmark in advancing VLRMs. Code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/JCruan519/VLRMBench.",

A. thaliana displays a range of responses to deal with Pi starvation, but special attention was paid to root hair elongation in this study. A central player in the root hair pathway is the transcription factor ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6-LIKE 4 (RSL4), which has been found to be upregulated during the Pi stress. A Petri Net was created which could simulate the gene regulatory networks responsible for the increase in root hair length, as well as the resulting increase in root hair length. Notably, discrepancies between the model and the literature suggested an important role for RSL2 in regulating RSL4. In the future, the net designed in the current study could be used as a platform to develop hypotheses about the interaction between RSL2 and RSL4.",

On the other hand, it often encounters the dilemma among anchor features, model size, and rendering quality - large anchor features lead to large 3D models and high-quality rendering whereas reducing anchor features degrades Gaussian attribute prediction which leads to clear artifacts in the rendered textures and geometries. We design SOGS, an anchor-based 3D-GS technique that introduces second-order anchors to achieve superior rendering quality and reduced anchor features and model size simultaneously. Specifically, SOGS incorporates covariance-based second-order statistics and correlation across feature dimensions to augment features within each anchor, compensating for the reduced feature size and improving rendering quality effectively. In addition, it introduces a selective gradient loss to enhance the optimization of scene textures and scene geometries, leading to high-quality rendering with small anchor features. Extensive experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks show that SOGS achieves superior rendering quality in novel view synthesis with clearly reduced model size.",

To this end, we propose an estimator of KL divergence which is based on the von Mises expansion. Our closeness test attains optimal parametric rates under smoothness assumptions. Equipped with this test, which serves as a building block of our causal discovery algorithm to identify the causal structure between two multidimensional random variables, we establish sample complexity guarantees for our causal discovery method.

The essential prerequisite to understanding the microscopic mechanisms of this complex electronic landscape is to unveil the configuration and symmetry of the charge-density wave order. As to now, little consensus has been made on what symmetry is broken. Herein, we clarify the microscopic structure and symmetry breaking of the CDW phase in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity. Our approach is based on extracting coherent phonon spectra induced by three-dimensional CDW and comparing them to calculated phonon frequencies via density-functional theory. The combination of these experimental results and calculations provides compelling evidence that the CDW structure of both compounds prevailing up to T$_{\\text{CDW}}$ is the 2 $\\times$ 2 $\\times$ 2 staggered inverse Star-of-David pattern with interlayer $\\pi$ phase shift, in which the six-fold rotational symmetry is broken.

This study presents an advanced evaluation of the developed open-source fabrication software Augmented Carpentry (AC), focusing on the technical challenges, potential bottlenecks, and precision of the proposed system, which is designed to recognize both objects and tools. In the workflow, computer vision tools and sensors implement inside-out tracking techniques for the retrofitting tools. This method enables operators to perform precise saw-cutting and drilling tasks using computer-generated feedback. In the design and manufacturing process pipeline, manual fabrication tasks are performed directly from the computer-aided design environment, as computer numerical control machines are widely used in the timber construction industry. Traditional non-digital methods employing execution drawings, markings, and jigs can now be replaced, and manual labor can be directly integrated into the digital value chain. First, this paper introduces the developed methodology and explains its devices and functional phases in detail. Second, the fabrication methodology is evaluated by experimentally scanning the produced one-to-one scale mock-up elements and comparing the discrepancies with their respective three-dimensional execution models. Finally, improvements and limitations in the tool-aware fabrication process, as well as the potential impact of AC in the digital timber fabrication landscape, are discussed.",

        "summary": "In the past decade, $>$1 Gsps ADCs have become commonplace and are used in many modern 5G base station chips. A major driving force behind this adoption is the benefits of digital up/down-conversion and improved digital filtering. Recent works have also advocated for utilizing this high sampling bandwidth to fit-in multiple MIMO streams, and reduce the number of ADCs required to build MIMO base-stations. This can potentially reduce the cost of Massive MIMO RUs, since ADCs are the most expensive electronics in the base-station radio chain. However, these recent works do not model the necessary decimation filters that exist in the signal path of these high sampling rate ADCs. We show in this short paper that because of the decimation filters, there can be introduction of cross-talks which can hinder the performance of these shared ADC interfaces. We simulate the shared ADC interface with Matlab 5G toolbox for uplink MIMO, and show that these cross-talks can be mitigated by performing MMSE equalization atop the PUSCH estimated channels.",

One important task is information retrieval (IR), which requires models to retrieve relevant documents. Despite its importance in many real-life applications, especially in retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, this task lacks Vietnamese benchmarks. This situation causes difficulty in assessing and comparing many existing Vietnamese embedding language models on the task and slows down the advancement of Vietnamese natural language processing (NLP) research. In this work, we aim to provide the Vietnamese research community with a new benchmark for information retrieval, which mainly focuses on retrieval and reranking tasks. Furthermore, we also present a new objective function based on the InfoNCE loss function, which is used to train our Vietnamese embedding model. Our function aims to be better than the origin in information retrieval tasks. Finally, we analyze the effect of temperature, a hyper-parameter in both objective functions, on the performance of text embedding models.",

Despite previous notions of supercells being uncommon in Europe, the model shows ~700 supercells per convective season. Occurrence peaks are co-located with complex topography e.g. the Alps. The absolute frequency maximum lies along the southern Alps with minima over the oceans and flat areas. Contrasting a current-climate simulation with a pseudo-global-warming +3$^\\circ$C global warming scenario, the future climate simulation shows an average increase of supercell occurrence by 11 %.

Recent open-set methods leverage text prompts, visual cues, or prompt-free paradigm to overcome this, but often compromise between performance and efficiency due to high computational demands or deployment complexity. In this work, we introduce YOLOE, which integrates detection and segmentation across diverse open prompt mechanisms within a single highly efficient model, achieving real-time seeing anything. For text prompts, we propose Re-parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) strategy. It refines pretrained textual embeddings via a re-parameterizable lightweight auxiliary network and enhances visual-textual alignment with zero inference and transferring overhead. For visual prompts, we present Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE). It employs decoupled semantic and activation branches to bring improved visual embedding and accuracy with minimal complexity. For prompt-free scenario, we introduce Lazy Region-Prompt Contrast (LRPC) strategy. It utilizes a built-in large vocabulary and specialized embedding to identify all objects, avoiding costly language model dependency. Extensive experiments show YOLOE's exceptional zero-shot performance and transferability with high inference efficiency and low training cost. Notably, on LVIS, with 3$\\times$ less training cost and 1.4$\\times$ inference speedup, YOLOE-v8-S surpasses YOLO-Worldv2-S by 3.5 AP.

        "summary": "While cryptographic algorithms such as the ubiquitous Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are secure, *physical implementations* of these algorithms in hardware inevitably 'leak' sensitive data such as cryptographic keys. A particularly insidious form of leakage arises from the fact that hardware consumes power and emits radiation in a manner that is statistically associated with the data it processes and the instructions it executes. Supervised deep learning has emerged as a state-of-the-art tool for carrying out *side-channel attacks*, which exploit this leakage by learning to map power/radiation measurements throughout encryption to the sensitive data operated on during that encryption. In this work we develop a principled deep learning framework for determining the relative leakage due to measurements recorded at different points in time, in order to inform *defense* against such attacks. This information is invaluable to cryptographic hardware designers for understanding *why* their hardware leaks and how they can mitigate it (e.g. by indicating the particular sections of code or electronic components which are responsible). Our framework is based on an adversarial game between a family of classifiers trained to estimate the conditional distributions of sensitive data given subsets of measurements, and a budget-constrained noise distribution which probabilistically erases individual measurements to maximize the loss of these classifiers. We demonstrate our method's efficacy and ability to overcome limitations of prior work through extensive experimental comparison with 8 baseline methods using 3 evaluation metrics and 6 publicly-available power/EM trace datasets from AES, ECC and RSA implementations. We provide an open-source PyTorch implementation of these experiments.",

Conventional fault detection methods depend on continuous, high-frequency vibration sensing, digitising, and wireless transmission to the cloud-an approach that significantly drains the limited energy reserves of battery-powered sensors, accelerating their depletion and increasing maintenance costs. This work proposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous vibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to specific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as the key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the machinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital conversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the sensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach, we use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets, examining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also consider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices, and the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested energy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and severities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a diagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance strategy for fault detection in smart machinery.",

We assume that the photovoltaic system is composed of a photovoltaic panel and a battery, where the photovoltaic panel produces energy according to a certain stochastic process. The management of the battery is the responsibility of a group administrator, who makes the joint decision to either store part of the photovoltaic energy production and sell the remaining energy at the electricity spot price, or discharge part of the energy stored in the battery and sell it in the electricity market. Inspired by European Union and Italian legislation, which promote incentives for energy transition and renewable energy production, we assume that the group receives a monetary incentive for the virtual self-consumed energy, defined as the minimum between the power bought from the grid to satisfy the group's power demand and the energy sold to the market. In this case, the energy sold by the group is a mix of part of the photovoltaic production that is not stored and part of the energy discharged from the battery. We model the problem as a stochastic optimal control problem, where the optimal strategy is the joint charge-discharge decision that minimizes the group's energy consumption costs. We find the solution numerically by applying a finite difference scheme to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the value function of the optimal control problem.",

However conventional ITR systems typically only rely on global image or text representations for measuring patient image/report similarities, which overlook local distinctiveness across patient cases. This often results in suboptimal retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose an Anatomical Location-Conditioned Image-Text Retrieval (ALC-ITR) framework, which, given a query image and the associated suspicious anatomical region(s), aims to retrieve similar patient cases exhibiting the same disease or symptoms in the same anatomical region. To perform location-conditioned multimodal retrieval, we learn a medical Relevance-Region-Aligned Vision Language (RRA-VL) model with semantic global-level and region-/word-level alignment to produce generalizable, well-aligned multi-modal representations. Additionally, we perform location-conditioned contrastive learning to further utilize cross-pair region-level contrastiveness for improved multi-modal retrieval. We show that our proposed RRA-VL achieves state-of-the-art localization performance in phase-grounding tasks, and satisfying multi-modal retrieval performance with or without location conditioning. Finally, we thoroughly investigate the generalizability and explainability of our proposed ALC-ITR system in providing explanations and preliminary diagnosis reports given retrieved patient cases (conditioned on anatomical regions), with proper off-the-shelf LLM prompts.",

As a result, we show that the theory propagates an additional degree of freedom, with respect to the generalized Proca theories, whose kinetic term suggests the presence of several strong coupling regimes that depend on the value of the background solution, the combination and vanishing of coupling constants, together with a scale-dependent one. We show in addition, that the speed of propagation for this mode vanishes, indicating the presence of another type of strong coupling. To further investigate this, we extend our analysis to the Bianchi Type I Universe, with the most general solution for the vector field. We show that the extra degree of freedom remains in the theory. Among the modes, we further show that the mode with vanishing speed of propagation is still present, pointing to the strong coupling. In addition, we discover a mode with scale-dependent strong coupling (vanishing kinetic term), one mode that propagates only in one single direction and two unstable modes.",

        "summary": "Language model alignment (or, reinforcement learning) techniques that leverage active exploration -- deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, informative responses -- offer the promise of super-human capabilities. However, current understanding of algorithm design primitives for computationally efficient exploration with language models is limited. To better understand how to leverage access to powerful pre-trained generative models to improve the efficiency of exploration, we introduce a new computational framework for RL with language models, in which the learner interacts with the model through a sampling oracle. Focusing on the linear softmax model parameterization, we provide new results that reveal the computational-statistical tradeoffs of efficient exploration: 1. Necessity of coverage: Coverage refers to the extent to which the pre-trained model covers near-optimal responses -- a form of hidden knowledge. We show that coverage, while not necessary for data efficiency, lower bounds the runtime of any algorithm in our framework. 2. Inference-time exploration: We introduce a new algorithm, SpannerSampling, which obtains optimal data efficiency and is computationally efficient whenever the pre-trained model enjoys sufficient coverage, matching our lower bound. SpannerSampling leverages inference-time computation with the pre-trained model to reduce the effective search space for exploration. 3. Insufficiency of training-time interventions: We contrast the result above by showing that training-time interventions that produce proper policies cannot achieve similar guarantees in polynomial time. 4. Computational benefits of multi-turn exploration: Finally, we show that under additional representational assumptions, one can achieve improved runtime (replacing sequence-level coverage with token-level coverage) through multi-turn exploration.",

However, obtaining an accurate approximation of these advection processes is challenging, even with modern measuring equipment, such as high-frequency radar or advanced simulations based on oceanic flow models. Therefore this paper presents a data-driven framework to approximate sea surface velocity from spatially distributed observations, thus enabling efficient probability advection modeling across submesoscale domains. The system approximates transient flows by leveraging quasi-steady flow assumptions. To overcome the limitations of point measurements in capturing domain-wide circulation, the method employs a fusion of two simplified 2D flow models to approximate submesoscale dynamics, enabling complete velocity field reconstruction from scattered data. To ensure reliable flow dynamics, the approach iteratively adjusts boundary conditions in numerical simulations to align the simulated flow with observations. Experimental validation in Kvarner Bay using GPS-tracked drifters confirmed the system's ability to replace computationally intensive transient simulations by approximating flow fields based on model simplifications. The results demonstrate its efficiency across domains, making it a practical tool for real-world submesoscale applications requiring swift passive scalar advection.",

In particular, low oxygen levels (hypoxia) activate the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor(HIF) pathway which has an array of target systems. One of these systems is Integrin-Linked Kinase (ILK) pathway, which influences key signaling pathways for cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Hence, this paper aimed to explore the interconnection between these two pathways. Using the Petri net modeling tool Snoopy, an established HIF network model was transformed to be a continuous Petri net. Subsequently, the network was expanded to incorporate a feedback element from the ILK pathway to HIF, based on gene expression data. The resulting model conserved the oxygen switch response of the original HIF model and positively amplified HIF's output. Therefore, this model provides a starting point for establishing a system reflecting crucial effect on hypoxia-induced cancer behavior, and could potentially serve as a basis for future drug development.",

These lead to various peculiar phenomena, one of which being the piston effect where a sudden heating induces a mechanical pulse. The coupling between thermal and mechanical processes, in the linear approximation, yields a non-trivially rich thermoacoustics. The numerous applications of supercritical fluids raise the need for reliable yet fast and efficient numerical solution for thermoacoustic time and space dependence in this sensitive domain. Here, we present a second-order accurate, fully explicit staggered space-time grid finite difference method for such coupled linear thermoacoustic problems. Time integration is based on the splitting of the state space vector field representing the interactions that affect the dynamics into reversible and irreversible parts, which splitting procedure leads to decoupled wave and heat equations. The former is a hyperbolic partial differential equation, while the latter is a parabolic one, therefore, different time integration algorithms must be amalgamated to obtain a reliable, dispersion error-free, and dissipation error-free numerical solution. Finally, the thermoacoustic approximation of the supercritical piston effect is investigated via the developed method.",

Each day, each vertex updates its color following the majority among its neighbors, using its previous color for tie-breaking. The dynamics achieves \\textit{unanimity} if every vertex has the same color after finitely many days, and such color is said to \\textit{win}. When $G$ is a $G(n,p)$ random graph, L. Tran and Vu (2019) found a codition in terms of $p$ and the initial difference $2\\Delta$ beteween the sizes of the Red and Blue camps, such that unanimity is achieved with probability arbitrarily close to 1. They showed that if $p\\Delta^2 \\gg1 $, $p\\Delta \\geq 100$, and $p\\geq (1+\\varepsilon) n^{-1}\\log n$ for a positive constant $\\varepsilon$, then unanimity occurs with probability $1 - o(1)$. If $p$ is not extremely small, namely $p > \\log^{-1/16} n $, then Sah and Sawhney (2022) showed that the condition $p\\Delta^2 \\gg 1$ is sufficient. If $n^{-1}\\log^2 n \\ll p \\ll n^{-1/2}\\log^{1/4} n$, we show that $p^{3/2}\\Delta \\gg n^{-1/2}\\log n$ is enough. Since this condition holds if $p\\Delta \\geq 100$ for $p$ in this range, this is an improvement of Tran's and Vu's result. For the closely related problem of finding the optimal condition for $p$ to achieve unanimity when the initial coloring is chosen uniformly at random among all possible Red/Blue assignments, our result implies a new lower bound $p \\gg n^{-2/3}\\log^{2/3} n$, which improves upon the previous bound of $n^{-3/5}\\log n$ by Chakraborti, Kim, Lee and T.

SpliCER is compatible with any self-supervised loss function and can be integrated into existing methods without modification.

We find that microwave power generates a higher quasiparticle density as the active resonator volume is reduced and show that this effect sets a sensitivity limit on kinetic inductance detectors. We compare our results with theoretical models of direct microwave photon absorption by quasiparticles and conclude that an unknown, indirect mechanism plays a dominant role in quasiparticle generation.

The 1.3 THz phonon pair and the 1.84 THz mode are observed up to the CDW transition temperature. Combining density-functional theory calculations, we point out these phonon pairs arise from the coexistence of Star-of-David and inverse Star-of-David distortions combined with six-fold rotational symmetry breaking. An anisotropy in the magnitude of transient reflectivity change is also revealed at the onset of CDW order. Our results thus indicate broken six-fold rotational symmetry in the charge-density wave state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, along with the absence of nematic fluctuation above T$_{\\text{CDW}}$.

        "summary": "Recently, multimodal large models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in visual understanding and reasoning across various vision-language tasks. However, MLLMs usually perform poorly in zero-shot medical disease recognition, as they do not fully exploit the captured features and available medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LLaVA-RadZ, a simple yet effective framework for zero-shot medical disease recognition. Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities, which effectively utilizes image and text representations and facilitates robust cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. DKAM improves category-level alignment, allowing for accurate disease recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition and exhibits the state-of-the-art performance compared to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.",

So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of approximately -8 dB in the fundamental mode, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest recorded for pulsed squeezing. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links. This work completes the set of capabilities needed for robust multimode squeezed light detection and significantly expands its applicability in quantum technologies.",

        "summary": "Lane topology extraction involves detecting lanes and traffic elements and determining their relationships, a key perception task for mapless autonomous driving. This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by vision-language foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chain-of-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance. We evaluate the method on the OpenLane-V2 dataset, showing consistent improvements across various baseline detectors.

Here, we analyse the properties of ICL in the massive cluster Abell 2390 at redshift z=0.228. Our analysis is based on the deep images obtained by the Euclid mission as part of the Early Release Observations in the near-infrared (Y, J, H bands), using the NISP instrument in a 0.75 deg$^2$ field. We subtracted a point--spread function (PSF) model and removed the Galactic cirrus contribution in each band after modelling it with the DAWIS software. We then applied three methods to detect, characterise, and model the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the CICLE 2D multi-galaxy fitting; the DAWIS wavelet-based multiscale software; and a mask-based 1D profile fitting. We detect ICL out to 600 kpc. The ICL fractions derived by our three methods range between 18% and 36% (average of 24%), while the BCG+ICL fractions are between 21% and 41% (average of 29%), depending on the band and method. A galaxy density map based on 219 selected cluster members shows a strong cluster substructure to the south-east and a smaller feature to the north-west. Based on colours, the ICL (out to about 400 kpc) seems to be built by the accretion of small systems (M ~ $10^{9.5}$ solar mass), or from stars coming from the outskirts of Milky Way-type galaxies (M ~ $10^{10}$ solar mass). Though Abell 2390 does not seem to be undergoing a merger, it is not yet fully relaxed, since it has accreted two groups that have not fully merged with the cluster core. We estimate that the contributions to the inner 300 kpc of the ICL of the north-west and south-east subgroups are 21% and 9% respectively.",

In this work, we propose a novel approach - Bayesian Membership Inference Attack (BMIA), which performs conditional attack through Bayesian inference. In particular, we transform a trained reference model into Bayesian neural networks by Laplace approximation, enabling the direct estimation of the conditional score distribution by probabilistic model parameters. Our method addresses both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty with only a reference model, enabling efficient and powerful MIA.

Our approach incorporates an active data generation strategy to maximize the utility of the generated motions, along with a local feature alignment mechanism that transfers natural movement patterns from walking data to enhance both the success rate and naturalness of the synthesized motions.

A classic study by Taylor (2022) showed that heavy inertial point particles (having density parameter R = 1) are trapped by the flow separatrices when the particle Stokes number St, which measures the particle's inertia, is less than 1/4. Here, we consider finitely dense particles, incorporating the previously neglected effects of added mass and the Boussinesq-Basset history force. Using linear stability analysis near stagnation points, we determine the critical parametric conditions in the St-R plane that leads to particle trapping within vortex cells. We identify additional stagnation points perceived by inertial particles, beyond the traditional ones at vortex cell corners, when the added mass effect is included, and we analyze their stability. Numerical analysis of the full nonlinear system confirms the existence of distinct particle behaviours--trapped, diffusive, and ballistic--depending on initial conditions, consistent with Nath et al. (2024), with modifications due to added mass effect. We delineate the regions in the St-R plane where these behaviours dominate based on the prominent particle dynamics. However, when both the history force and added mass effect are included, all particles exhibit ballistic motion regardless of St and R.",

AI-based approaches appear to be up to the challenge, but in production they must not only achieve high success rates. They must also ensure insertion quality and reliability. To address this, we introduce QBIT, a quality-aware benchmarking framework that incorporates additional metrics such as force energy, force smoothness and completion time to provide a comprehensive assessment. To ensure statistical significance and minimize the sim-to-real gap, we randomize contact parameters in the MuJoCo simulator, account for perceptual uncertainty, and conduct large-scale experiments on a Kubernetes-based infrastructure. Our microservice-oriented architecture ensures extensibility, broad applicability, and improved reproducibility. To facilitate seamless transitions to physical robotic testing, we use ROS2 with containerization to reduce integration barriers. We evaluate QBIT using three insertion approaches: geometricbased, force-based, and learning-based, in both simulated and real-world environments. In simulation, we compare the accuracy of contact simulation using different mesh decomposition techniques. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of QBIT in comparing different insertion approaches and accelerating the transition from laboratory to real-world applications.

        "summary": "Although large visual-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in multimodal tasks, errors may occasionally arise due to biases during the reasoning process. Recently, reward models (RMs) have become increasingly pivotal in the reasoning process. Specifically, process RMs evaluate each reasoning step, outcome RMs focus on the assessment of reasoning results, and critique RMs perform error analysis on the entire reasoning process, followed by corrections. However, existing benchmarks for vision-language RMs (VLRMs) typically assess only a single aspect of their capabilities (e.g., distinguishing between two answers), thus limiting the all-round evaluation and restricting the development of RMs in the visual-language domain. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark, dubbed as VLRMBench, encompassing 12,634 questions. VLRMBench is constructed based on three distinct types of datasets, covering mathematical reasoning, hallucination understanding, and multi-image understanding. We design 12 tasks across three major categories, focusing on evaluating VLRMs in the aspects of process understanding, outcome judgment, and critique generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on 21 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models, highlighting the challenges posed by VLRMBench. For instance, in the `Forecasting Future', a binary classification task, the advanced GPT-4o achieves only a 76.0% accuracy. Additionally, we perform comprehensive analytical studies, offering valuable insights for the future development of VLRMs. We anticipate that VLRMBench will serve as a pivotal benchmark in advancing VLRMs. Code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/JCruan519/VLRMBench.",

In order to understand better the underlying mechanism of plant response to Pi, the response to phosphate starvation in Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated through use of Petri Nets, a formal language suitable for bio-modeling. A. thaliana displays a range of responses to deal with Pi starvation, but special attention was paid to root hair elongation in this study. A central player in the root hair pathway is the transcription factor ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6-LIKE 4 (RSL4), which has been found to be upregulated during the Pi stress. A Petri Net was created which could simulate the gene regulatory networks responsible for the increase in root hair length, as well as the resulting increase in root hair length. Notably, discrepancies between the model and the literature suggested an important role for RSL2 in regulating RSL4. In the future, the net designed in the current study could be used as a platform to develop hypotheses about the interaction between RSL2 and RSL4.",

On the other hand, it often encounters the dilemma among anchor features, model size, and rendering quality - large anchor features lead to large 3D models and high-quality rendering whereas reducing anchor features degrades Gaussian attribute prediction which leads to clear artifacts in the rendered textures and geometries. We design SOGS, an anchor-based 3D-GS technique that introduces second-order anchors to achieve superior rendering quality and reduced anchor features and model size simultaneously. Specifically, SOGS incorporates covariance-based second-order statistics and correlation across feature dimensions to augment features within each anchor, compensating for the reduced feature size and improving rendering quality effectively. In addition, it introduces a selective gradient loss to enhance the optimization of scene textures and scene geometries, leading to high-quality rendering with small anchor features. Extensive experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks show that SOGS achieves superior rendering quality in novel view synthesis with clearly reduced model size.",

To this end, we propose an estimator of KL divergence which is based on the von Mises expansion. Our closeness test attains optimal parametric rates under smoothness assumptions. Equipped with this test, which serves as a building block of our causal discovery algorithm to identify the causal structure between two multidimensional random variables, we establish sample complexity guarantees for our causal discovery method.

The essential prerequisite to understanding the microscopic mechanisms of this complex electronic landscape is to unveil the configuration and symmetry of the charge-density wave order. As to now, little consensus has been made on what symmetry is broken. Herein, we clarify the microscopic structure and symmetry breaking of the CDW phase in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity. Our approach is based on extracting coherent phonon spectra induced by three-dimensional CDW and comparing them to calculated phonon frequencies via density-functional theory. The combination of these experimental results and calculations provides compelling evidence that the CDW structure of both compounds prevailing up to T$_{\\text{CDW}}$ is the 2 $\\times$ 2 $\\times$ 2 staggered inverse Star-of-David pattern with interlayer $\\pi$ phase shift, in which the six-fold rotational symmetry is broken.

This study presents an advanced evaluation of the developed open-source fabrication software Augmented Carpentry (AC), focusing on the technical challenges, potential bottlenecks, and precision of the proposed system, which is designed to recognize both objects and tools. In the workflow, computer vision tools and sensors implement inside-out tracking techniques for the retrofitting tools. This method enables operators to perform precise saw-cutting and drilling tasks using computer-generated feedback. In the design and manufacturing process pipeline, manual fabrication tasks are performed directly from the computer-aided design environment, as computer numerical control machines are widely used in the timber construction industry. Traditional non-digital methods employing execution drawings, markings, and jigs can now be replaced, and manual labor can be directly integrated into the digital value chain. First, this paper introduces the developed methodology and explains its devices and functional phases in detail. Second, the fabrication methodology is evaluated by experimentally scanning the produced one-to-one scale mock-up elements and comparing the discrepancies with their respective three-dimensional execution models. Finally, improvements and limitations in the tool-aware fabrication process, as well as the potential impact of AC in the digital timber fabrication landscape, are discussed.",

A major driving force behind this adoption is the benefits of digital up/down-conversion and improved digital filtering. Recent works have also advocated for utilizing this high sampling bandwidth to fit-in multiple MIMO streams, and reduce the number of ADCs required to build MIMO base-stations. This can potentially reduce the cost of Massive MIMO RUs, since ADCs are the most expensive electronics in the base-station radio chain. However, these recent works do not model the necessary decimation filters that exist in the signal path of these high sampling rate ADCs. We show in this short paper that because of the decimation filters, there can be introduction of cross-talks which can hinder the performance of these shared ADC interfaces. We simulate the shared ADC interface with Matlab 5G toolbox for uplink MIMO, and show that these cross-talks can be mitigated by performing MMSE equalization atop the PUSCH estimated channels.",

Recent open-set methods leverage text prompts, visual cues, or prompt-free paradigm to overcome this, but often compromise between performance and efficiency due to high computational demands or deployment complexity. In this work, we introduce YOLOE, which integrates detection and segmentation across diverse open prompt mechanisms within a single highly efficient model, achieving real-time seeing anything.

It employs decoupled semantic and activation branches to bring improved visual embedding and accuracy with minimal complexity. For prompt-free scenario, we introduce Lazy Region-Prompt Contrast (LRPC) strategy.

A particularly insidious form of leakage arises from the fact that hardware consumes power and emits radiation in a manner that is statistically associated with the data it processes and the instructions it executes. Supervised deep learning has emerged as a state-of-the-art tool for carrying out *side-channel attacks*, which exploit this leakage by learning to map power/radiation measurements throughout encryption to the sensitive data operated on during that encryption. In this work we develop a principled deep learning framework for determining the relative leakage due to measurements recorded at different points in time, in order to inform *defense* against such attacks. This information is invaluable to cryptographic hardware designers for understanding *why* their hardware leaks and how they can mitigate it (e.g. by indicating the particular sections of code or electronic components which are responsible). Our framework is based on an adversarial game between a family of classifiers trained to estimate the conditional distributions of sensitive data given subsets of measurements, and a budget-constrained noise distribution which probabilistically erases individual measurements to maximize the loss of these classifiers. We demonstrate our method's efficacy and ability to overcome limitations of prior work through extensive experimental comparison with 8 baseline methods using 3 evaluation metrics and 6 publicly-available power/EM trace datasets from AES, ECC and RSA implementations.

This work proposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous vibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to specific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as the key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the machinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital conversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the sensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach, we use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets, examining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also consider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices, and the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested energy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and severities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a diagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance strategy for fault detection in smart machinery.",

We assume that the photovoltaic system is composed of a photovoltaic panel and a battery, where the photovoltaic panel produces energy according to a certain stochastic process. The management of the battery is the responsibility of a group administrator, who makes the joint decision to either store part of the photovoltaic energy production and sell the remaining energy at the electricity spot price, or discharge part of the energy stored in the battery and sell it in the electricity market. Inspired by European Union and Italian legislation, which promote incentives for energy transition and renewable energy production, we assume that the group receives a monetary incentive for the virtual self-consumed energy, defined as the minimum between the power bought from the grid to satisfy the group's power demand and the energy sold to the market. In this case, the energy sold by the group is a mix of part of the photovoltaic production that is not stored and part of the energy discharged from the battery. We model the problem as a stochastic optimal control problem, where the optimal strategy is the joint charge-discharge decision that minimizes the group's energy consumption costs. We find the solution numerically by applying a finite difference scheme to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the value function of the optimal control problem.",

We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints.

However conventional ITR systems typically only rely on global image or text representations for measuring patient image/report similarities, which overlook local distinctiveness across patient cases. This often results in suboptimal retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose an Anatomical Location-Conditioned Image-Text Retrieval (ALC-ITR) framework, which, given a query image and the associated suspicious anatomical region(s), aims to retrieve similar patient cases exhibiting the same disease or symptoms in the same anatomical region. To perform location-conditioned multimodal retrieval, we learn a medical Relevance-Region-Aligned Vision Language (RRA-VL) model with semantic global-level and region-/word-level alignment to produce generalizable, well-aligned multi-modal representations. Additionally, we perform location-conditioned contrastive learning to further utilize cross-pair region-level contrastiveness for improved multi-modal retrieval. We show that our proposed RRA-VL achieves state-of-the-art localization performance in phase-grounding tasks, and satisfying multi-modal retrieval performance with or without location conditioning. Finally, we thoroughly investigate the generalizability and explainability of our proposed ALC-ITR system in providing explanations and preliminary diagnosis reports given retrieved patient cases (conditioned on anatomical regions), with proper off-the-shelf LLM prompts.",

In this article, we investigate the effect of high processor connectivity on average two qubit gate fidelity in a cavity based architecture with tunable coupling. Via a perturbative approach, we quantify the cross-talk errors from transverse residual couplings and show that they scale as $nm^2$ where $n$ is the number of idle qubits and $m$ is the ratio between the transverse residual and active couplings. Setting an error threshold $E_\\mathrm{thr}$, we demonstrate that cross-talks restrict the hardware topology and prevent the full use of all-to-all connectivity.

We show in addition, that the speed of propagation for this mode vanishes, indicating the presence of another type of strong coupling. To further investigate this, we extend our analysis to the Bianchi Type I Universe, with the most general solution for the vector field. We show that the extra degree of freedom remains in the theory. Among the modes, we further show that the mode with vanishing speed of propagation is still present, pointing to the strong coupling.

However, current understanding of algorithm design primitives for computationally efficient exploration with language models is limited. To better understand how to leverage access to powerful pre-trained generative models to improve the efficiency of exploration, we introduce a new computational framework for RL with language models, in which the learner interacts with the model through a sampling oracle. Focusing on the linear softmax model parameterization, we provide new results that reveal the computational-statistical tradeoffs of efficient exploration: 1. Necessity of coverage: Coverage refers to the extent to which the pre-trained model covers near-optimal responses -- a form of hidden knowledge. We show that coverage, while not necessary for data efficiency, lower bounds the runtime of any algorithm in our framework. 2. Inference-time exploration: We introduce a new algorithm, SpannerSampling, which obtains optimal data efficiency and is computationally efficient whenever the pre-trained model enjoys sufficient coverage, matching our lower bound. SpannerSampling leverages inference-time computation with the pre-trained model to reduce the effective search space for exploration. 3. Insufficiency of training-time interventions: We contrast the result above by showing that training-time interventions that produce proper policies cannot achieve similar guarantees in polynomial time. 4. Computational benefits of multi-turn exploration: Finally, we show that under additional representational assumptions, one can achieve improved runtime (replacing sequence-level coverage with token-level coverage) through multi-turn exploration.",

Therefore this paper presents a data-driven framework to approximate sea surface velocity from spatially distributed observations, thus enabling efficient probability advection modeling across submesoscale domains. The system approximates transient flows by leveraging quasi-steady flow assumptions. To overcome the limitations of point measurements in capturing domain-wide circulation, the method employs a fusion of two simplified 2D flow models to approximate submesoscale dynamics, enabling complete velocity field reconstruction from scattered data. To ensure reliable flow dynamics, the approach iteratively adjusts boundary conditions in numerical simulations to align the simulated flow with observations. Experimental validation in Kvarner Bay using GPS-tracked drifters confirmed the system's ability to replace computationally intensive transient simulations by approximating flow fields based on model simplifications. The results demonstrate its efficiency across domains, making it a practical tool for real-world submesoscale applications requiring swift passive scalar advection.",

The coupling between thermal and mechanical processes, in the linear approximation, yields a non-trivially rich thermoacoustics. The numerous applications of supercritical fluids raise the need for reliable yet fast and efficient numerical solution for thermoacoustic time and space dependence in this sensitive domain. Here, we present a second-order accurate, fully explicit staggered space-time grid finite difference method for such coupled linear thermoacoustic problems. Time integration is based on the splitting of the state space vector field representing the interactions that affect the dynamics into reversible and irreversible parts, which splitting procedure leads to decoupled wave and heat equations. The former is a hyperbolic partial differential equation, while the latter is a parabolic one, therefore, different time integration algorithms must be amalgamated to obtain a reliable, dispersion error-free, and dissipation error-free numerical solution. Finally, the thermoacoustic approximation of the supercritical piston effect is investigated via the developed method.",

The dynamics achieves \\textit{unanimity} if every vertex has the same color after finitely many days, and such color is said to \\textit{win}. When $G$ is a $G(n,p)$ random graph, L. Tran and Vu (2019) found a codition in terms of $p$ and the initial difference $2\\Delta$ beteween the sizes of the Red and Blue camps, such that unanimity is achieved with probability arbitrarily close to 1. They showed that if $p\\Delta^2 \\gg1 $, $p\\Delta \\geq 100$, and $p\\geq (1+\\varepsilon) n^{-1}\\log n$ for a positive constant $\\varepsilon$, then unanimity occurs with probability $1 - o(1)$. If $p$ is not extremely small, namely $p > \\log^{-1/16} n $, then Sah and Sawhney (2022) showed that the condition $p\\Delta^2 \\gg 1$ is sufficient. If $n^{-1}\\log^2 n \\ll p \\ll n^{-1/2}\\log^{1/4} n$, we show that $p^{3/2}\\Delta \\gg n^{-1/2}\\log n$ is enough. Since this condition holds if $p\\Delta \\geq 100$ for $p$ in this range, this is an improvement of Tran's and Vu's result. For the closely related problem of finding the optimal condition for $p$ to achieve unanimity when the initial coloring is chosen uniformly at random among all possible Red/Blue assignments, our result implies a new lower bound $p \\gg n^{-2/3}\\log^{2/3} n$, which improves upon the previous bound of $n^{-3/5}\\log n$ by Chakraborti, Kim, Lee and T.

Given a subgroup $J$ of an abelian group $G$, a relative Heffter space is a resolvable configuration whose points form a half-set of $G\\setminus{J}$ and whose blocks are all zero-sum in $G$. Here we present two infinite families of relative Heffter spaces satisfying the additional condition of being simple. As a consequence, we get new results on globally simple relative Heffter arrays, on mutually orthogonal cycle decompositions and on biembeddings of cyclic cycle decompositions of the complete multipartite graph into an orientable surface.",

This limitation is particularly problematic in applications to science and engineering, as complex features can be critical for discovery and analysis. To address this, we introduce Split Component Embedding Registration (SpliCER), a novel architecture which splits the image into sections and distils information from each section to guide the model to learn more subtle and complex features without compromising on simpler features. SpliCER is compatible with any self-supervised loss function and can be integrated into existing methods without modification. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: i) we demonstrate that existing self-supervised methods can learn shortcut solutions when simple and complex features are both present; ii) we introduce a novel self-supervised training method, SpliCER, to overcome the limitations of existing methods, and achieve significant downstream performance improvements; iii) we demonstrate the effectiveness of SpliCER in cutting-edge medical and geospatial imaging settings. SpliCER offers a powerful new tool for representation learning, enabling models to uncover complex features which could be overlooked by other methods.",

The readout signal can generate non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which lead to excess microwave loss and decoherence. To understand this effect quantitatively, we measure quasiparticle fluctuations and extract the quasiparticle density across different temperatures, readout powers, and resonator volumes. We find that microwave power generates a higher quasiparticle density as the active resonator volume is reduced and show that this effect sets a sensitivity limit on kinetic inductance detectors. We compare our results with theoretical models of direct microwave photon absorption by quasiparticles and conclude that an unknown, indirect mechanism plays a dominant role in quasiparticle generation. These results provide a route to mitigate quasiparticle generation due to readout power in superconducting devices.",

By extracting the coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, we discover close phonon pairs near 1.3 THz and 3.1 THz, as well as a new mode at 1.84 THz. The 1.3 THz phonon pair and the 1.84 THz mode are observed up to the CDW transition temperature. Combining density-functional theory calculations, we point out these phonon pairs arise from the coexistence of Star-of-David and inverse Star-of-David distortions combined with six-fold rotational symmetry breaking. An anisotropy in the magnitude of transient reflectivity change is also revealed at the onset of CDW order. Our results thus indicate broken six-fold rotational symmetry in the charge-density wave state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, along with the absence of nematic fluctuation above T$_{\\text{CDW}}$. Meanwhile, the measured coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-\\text{x}}$Sn$_\\text{x}$ with x = 0.03-0.04 matches with staggered inverse Star-of-David with interlayer $\\pi$ phase shift. This CDW structure contrasts with undoped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and explains the evolution from phonon pair to a single mode at 1.3 THz by x = 0.03-0.04 Sn-doping.",

In perturbative methods, this involves the evaluation of higher order corrections to the leading order (LO) scattering amplitudes, including real emissions and loop corrections. Although experimental uncertainties today are larger than those of simulations, at the High Luminosity LHC experimental precision is expected to be above the theoretical one for events generated below next-to-leading order (NLO) precision. As forecasted hardware resources will not meet CPU requirements for these simulation needs, speeding up NLO event generation is a necessity. In recent years, collaborators across Europe and the United States have been working on CPU vectorisation of LO event generation within the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework, as well as porting it to GPUs, to major success. Recently, development has also started on vectorising NLO event generation. Due to the more complicated nature of NLO amplitudes this development faces several difficulties not accounted for in the LO development, but it shows promise. Here, we present these issues as well as the current status of our event-parallel NLO implementation.",

In the high-quality sensor data regime, we focus on robust system identification based on the data informativity framework. In low-quality sensor data regimes we employ a robustly contracting controller that is synthesized online by solving a sum-of-squares program based on data acquired in the high-quality regime, so as to limit state deviation until high-quality data is available. This approach is motivated by real-life control applications in which systems experience periodic data blackouts or occlusion, such as autonomous vehicles undergoing loss of GPS signal or solar glare in machine vision systems. We apply our approach to a planar unmanned aerial vehicle model subject to an unknown wind field, demonstrating its uses for verifiably tight control on trajectory deviation.",

However, MLLMs usually perform poorly in zero-shot medical disease recognition, as they do not fully exploit the captured features and available medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LLaVA-RadZ, a simple yet effective framework for zero-shot medical disease recognition. Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities, which effectively utilizes image and text representations and facilitates robust cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. DKAM improves category-level alignment, allowing for accurate disease recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition and exhibits the state-of-the-art performance compared to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.",

So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of approximately -8 dB in the fundamental mode, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest recorded for pulsed squeezing. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links.

        "summary": "Lane topology extraction involves detecting lanes and traffic elements and determining their relationships, a key perception task for mapless autonomous driving. This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by vision-language foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chain-of-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance. We evaluate the method on the OpenLane-V2 dataset, showing consistent improvements across various baseline detectors.

Here, we analyse the properties of ICL in the massive cluster Abell 2390 at redshift z=0.228. Our analysis is based on the deep images obtained by the Euclid mission as part of the Early Release Observations in the near-infrared (Y, J, H bands), using the NISP instrument in a 0.75 deg$^2$ field. We subtracted a point--spread function (PSF) model and removed the Galactic cirrus contribution in each band after modelling it with the DAWIS software. We then applied three methods to detect, characterise, and model the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the CICLE 2D multi-galaxy fitting; the DAWIS wavelet-based multiscale software; and a mask-based 1D profile fitting. We detect ICL out to 600 kpc. The ICL fractions derived by our three methods range between 18% and 36% (average of 24%), while the BCG+ICL fractions are between 21% and 41% (average of 29%), depending on the band and method. A galaxy density map based on 219 selected cluster members shows a strong cluster substructure to the south-east and a smaller feature to the north-west. Based on colours, the ICL (out to about 400 kpc) seems to be built by the accretion of small systems (M ~ $10^{9.5}$ solar mass), or from stars coming from the outskirts of Milky Way-type galaxies (M ~ $10^{10}$ solar mass). Though Abell 2390 does not seem to be undergoing a merger, it is not yet fully relaxed, since it has accreted two groups that have not fully merged with the cluster core. We estimate that the contributions to the inner 300 kpc of the ICL of the north-west and south-east subgroups are 21% and 9% respectively.",

Previous attacks often utilize multiple reference models to approximate the conditional score distribution, leading to significant computational overhead. While recent work leverages quantile regression to estimate conditional thresholds, it fails to capture epistemic uncertainty, resulting in bias in low-density regions. In this work, we propose a novel approach - Bayesian Membership Inference Attack (BMIA), which performs conditional attack through Bayesian inference. In particular, we transform a trained reference model into Bayesian neural networks by Laplace approximation, enabling the direct estimation of the conditional score distribution by probabilistic model parameters. Our method addresses both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty with only a reference model, enabling efficient and powerful MIA. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of BMIA.",

Base on the observation that walking data captures valuable movement patterns transferable across tasks and, on the other hand, the advanced kinematic methods can generate diverse grasping poses, which can then be interpolated into motions to serve as task-specific guidance. Our approach incorporates an active data generation strategy to maximize the utility of the generated motions, along with a local feature alignment mechanism that transfers natural movement patterns from walking data to enhance both the success rate and naturalness of the synthesized motions. By combining the fidelity and stability of natural walking with the flexibility and generalizability of task-specific generated data, our method demonstrates strong performance and robust adaptability in diverse scenes and with unseen objects.",

A classic study by Taylor (2022) showed that heavy inertial point particles (having density parameter R = 1) are trapped by the flow separatrices when the particle Stokes number St, which measures the particle's inertia, is less than 1/4. Here, we consider finitely dense particles, incorporating the previously neglected effects of added mass and the Boussinesq-Basset history force. Using linear stability analysis near stagnation points, we determine the critical parametric conditions in the St-R plane that leads to particle trapping within vortex cells. We identify additional stagnation points perceived by inertial particles, beyond the traditional ones at vortex cell corners, when the added mass effect is included, and we analyze their stability. Numerical analysis of the full nonlinear system confirms the existence of distinct particle behaviours--trapped, diffusive, and ballistic--depending on initial conditions, consistent with Nath et al. (2024), with modifications due to added mass effect. We delineate the regions in the St-R plane where these behaviours dominate based on the prominent particle dynamics. However, when both the history force and added mass effect are included, all particles exhibit ballistic motion regardless of St and R.",

AI-based approaches appear to be up to the challenge, but in production they must not only achieve high success rates. They must also ensure insertion quality and reliability. To address this, we introduce QBIT, a quality-aware benchmarking framework that incorporates additional metrics such as force energy, force smoothness and completion time to provide a comprehensive assessment. To ensure statistical significance and minimize the sim-to-real gap, we randomize contact parameters in the MuJoCo simulator, account for perceptual uncertainty, and conduct large-scale experiments on a Kubernetes-based infrastructure. Our microservice-oriented architecture ensures extensibility, broad applicability, and improved reproducibility. To facilitate seamless transitions to physical robotic testing, we use ROS2 with containerization to reduce integration barriers. We evaluate QBIT using three insertion approaches: geometricbased, force-based, and learning-based, in both simulated and real-world environments. In simulation, we compare the accuracy of contact simulation using different mesh decomposition techniques. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of QBIT in comparing different insertion approaches and accelerating the transition from laboratory to real-world applications.

        "summary": "Although large visual-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in multimodal tasks, errors may occasionally arise due to biases during the reasoning process. Recently, reward models (RMs) have become increasingly pivotal in the reasoning process. Specifically, process RMs evaluate each reasoning step, outcome RMs focus on the assessment of reasoning results, and critique RMs perform error analysis on the entire reasoning process, followed by corrections. However, existing benchmarks for vision-language RMs (VLRMs) typically assess only a single aspect of their capabilities (e.g., distinguishing between two answers), thus limiting the all-round evaluation and restricting the development of RMs in the visual-language domain. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark, dubbed as VLRMBench, encompassing 12,634 questions. VLRMBench is constructed based on three distinct types of datasets, covering mathematical reasoning, hallucination understanding, and multi-image understanding. We design 12 tasks across three major categories, focusing on evaluating VLRMs in the aspects of process understanding, outcome judgment, and critique generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on 21 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models, highlighting the challenges posed by VLRMBench. For instance, in the `Forecasting Future', a binary classification task, the advanced GPT-4o achieves only a 76.0% accuracy. Additionally, we perform comprehensive analytical studies, offering valuable insights for the future development of VLRMs. We anticipate that VLRMBench will serve as a pivotal benchmark in advancing VLRMs. Code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/JCruan519/VLRMBench.",

A. thaliana displays a range of responses to deal with Pi starvation, but special attention was paid to root hair elongation in this study. A central player in the root hair pathway is the transcription factor ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6-LIKE 4 (RSL4), which has been found to be upregulated during the Pi stress. A Petri Net was created which could simulate the gene regulatory networks responsible for the increase in root hair length, as well as the resulting increase in root hair length. Notably, discrepancies between the model and the literature suggested an important role for RSL2 in regulating RSL4. In the future, the net designed in the current study could be used as a platform to develop hypotheses about the interaction between RSL2 and RSL4.",

On the other hand, it often encounters the dilemma among anchor features, model size, and rendering quality - large anchor features lead to large 3D models and high-quality rendering whereas reducing anchor features degrades Gaussian attribute prediction which leads to clear artifacts in the rendered textures and geometries. We design SOGS, an anchor-based 3D-GS technique that introduces second-order anchors to achieve superior rendering quality and reduced anchor features and model size simultaneously. Specifically, SOGS incorporates covariance-based second-order statistics and correlation across feature dimensions to augment features within each anchor, compensating for the reduced feature size and improving rendering quality effectively. In addition, it introduces a selective gradient loss to enhance the optimization of scene textures and scene geometries, leading to high-quality rendering with small anchor features. Extensive experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks show that SOGS achieves superior rendering quality in novel view synthesis with clearly reduced model size.",

To this end, we propose an estimator of KL divergence which is based on the von Mises expansion. Our closeness test attains optimal parametric rates under smoothness assumptions. Equipped with this test, which serves as a building block of our causal discovery algorithm to identify the causal structure between two multidimensional random variables, we establish sample complexity guarantees for our causal discovery method.

The essential prerequisite to understanding the microscopic mechanisms of this complex electronic landscape is to unveil the configuration and symmetry of the charge-density wave order. As to now, little consensus has been made on what symmetry is broken. Herein, we clarify the microscopic structure and symmetry breaking of the CDW phase in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity. Our approach is based on extracting coherent phonon spectra induced by three-dimensional CDW and comparing them to calculated phonon frequencies via density-functional theory. The combination of these experimental results and calculations provides compelling evidence that the CDW structure of both compounds prevailing up to T$_{\\text{CDW}}$ is the 2 $\\times$ 2 $\\times$ 2 staggered inverse Star-of-David pattern with interlayer $\\pi$ phase shift, in which the six-fold rotational symmetry is broken.

Second, the fabrication methodology is evaluated by experimentally scanning the produced one-to-one scale mock-up elements and comparing the discrepancies with their respective three-dimensional execution models.

This can potentially reduce the cost of Massive MIMO RUs, since ADCs are the most expensive electronics in the base-station radio chain. However, these recent works do not model the necessary decimation filters that exist in the signal path of these high sampling rate ADCs. We show in this short paper that because of the decimation filters, there can be introduction of cross-talks which can hinder the performance of these shared ADC interfaces.

        "summary": "We explore the implications of finite-temperature quantum field theory effects on cosmological parameters within the framework of the $\\Lambda$CDM model and its modification. By incorporating temperature-dependent corrections to the cosmological constant, we extend the standard cosmological model to include additional density parameters, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda_2}$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda_3}$, which arise from finite-T quantum gravitational effects. Using the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System, we analyze the impact of these corrections on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum and compare the results with the Planck 2018 data. Through brute-force parameter scans and advanced machine learning techniques, including quartic regression, we demonstrate that the inclusion of $\\Omega_{\\Lambda_2}$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda_3}$ improves the model's predictive accuracy, achieving high $R^2$ values and low mean squared error. The present work paves the way for future research into higher-order corrections and enhanced computational methods for cosmological parameter estimation.",

Despite previous notions of supercells being uncommon in Europe, the model shows ~700 supercells per convective season. Occurrence peaks are co-located with complex topography e.g. the Alps. The absolute frequency maximum lies along the southern Alps with minima over the oceans and flat areas. Contrasting a current-climate simulation with a pseudo-global-warming +3$^\\circ$C global warming scenario, the future climate simulation shows an average increase of supercell occurrence by 11 %.

Recent open-set methods leverage text prompts, visual cues, or prompt-free paradigm to overcome this, but often compromise between performance and efficiency due to high computational demands or deployment complexity. In this work, we introduce YOLOE, which integrates detection and segmentation across diverse open prompt mechanisms within a single highly efficient model, achieving real-time seeing anything. For text prompts, we propose Re-parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) strategy. It refines pretrained textual embeddings via a re-parameterizable lightweight auxiliary network and enhances visual-textual alignment with zero inference and transferring overhead. For visual prompts, we present Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE). It employs decoupled semantic and activation branches to bring improved visual embedding and accuracy with minimal complexity. For prompt-free scenario, we introduce Lazy Region-Prompt Contrast (LRPC) strategy. It utilizes a built-in large vocabulary and specialized embedding to identify all objects, avoiding costly language model dependency. Extensive experiments show YOLOE's exceptional zero-shot performance and transferability with high inference efficiency and low training cost. Notably, on LVIS, with 3$\\times$ less training cost and 1.4$\\times$ inference speedup, YOLOE-v8-S surpasses YOLO-Worldv2-S by 3.5 AP.

        "summary": "While cryptographic algorithms such as the ubiquitous Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are secure, *physical implementations* of these algorithms in hardware inevitably 'leak' sensitive data such as cryptographic keys. A particularly insidious form of leakage arises from the fact that hardware consumes power and emits radiation in a manner that is statistically associated with the data it processes and the instructions it executes. Supervised deep learning has emerged as a state-of-the-art tool for carrying out *side-channel attacks*, which exploit this leakage by learning to map power/radiation measurements throughout encryption to the sensitive data operated on during that encryption. In this work we develop a principled deep learning framework for determining the relative leakage due to measurements recorded at different points in time, in order to inform *defense* against such attacks. This information is invaluable to cryptographic hardware designers for understanding *why* their hardware leaks and how they can mitigate it (e.g. by indicating the particular sections of code or electronic components which are responsible). Our framework is based on an adversarial game between a family of classifiers trained to estimate the conditional distributions of sensitive data given subsets of measurements, and a budget-constrained noise distribution which probabilistically erases individual measurements to maximize the loss of these classifiers. We demonstrate our method's efficacy and ability to overcome limitations of prior work through extensive experimental comparison with 8 baseline methods using 3 evaluation metrics and 6 publicly-available power/EM trace datasets from AES, ECC and RSA implementations. We provide an open-source PyTorch implementation of these experiments.",

Conventional fault detection methods depend on continuous, high-frequency vibration sensing, digitising, and wireless transmission to the cloud-an approach that significantly drains the limited energy reserves of battery-powered sensors, accelerating their depletion and increasing maintenance costs. This work proposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous vibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to specific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as the key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the machinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital conversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the sensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach, we use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets, examining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also consider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices, and the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested energy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and severities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a diagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance strategy for fault detection in smart machinery.",

We assume that the photovoltaic system is composed of a photovoltaic panel and a battery, where the photovoltaic panel produces energy according to a certain stochastic process. The management of the battery is the responsibility of a group administrator, who makes the joint decision to either store part of the photovoltaic energy production and sell the remaining energy at the electricity spot price, or discharge part of the energy stored in the battery and sell it in the electricity market. Inspired by European Union and Italian legislation, which promote incentives for energy transition and renewable energy production, we assume that the group receives a monetary incentive for the virtual self-consumed energy, defined as the minimum between the power bought from the grid to satisfy the group's power demand and the energy sold to the market. In this case, the energy sold by the group is a mix of part of the photovoltaic production that is not stored and part of the energy discharged from the battery. We model the problem as a stochastic optimal control problem, where the optimal strategy is the joint charge-discharge decision that minimizes the group's energy consumption costs. We find the solution numerically by applying a finite difference scheme to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the value function of the optimal control problem.",

However conventional ITR systems typically only rely on global image or text representations for measuring patient image/report similarities, which overlook local distinctiveness across patient cases. This often results in suboptimal retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose an Anatomical Location-Conditioned Image-Text Retrieval (ALC-ITR) framework, which, given a query image and the associated suspicious anatomical region(s), aims to retrieve similar patient cases exhibiting the same disease or symptoms in the same anatomical region. To perform location-conditioned multimodal retrieval, we learn a medical Relevance-Region-Aligned Vision Language (RRA-VL) model with semantic global-level and region-/word-level alignment to produce generalizable, well-aligned multi-modal representations. Additionally, we perform location-conditioned contrastive learning to further utilize cross-pair region-level contrastiveness for improved multi-modal retrieval. We show that our proposed RRA-VL achieves state-of-the-art localization performance in phase-grounding tasks, and satisfying multi-modal retrieval performance with or without location conditioning. Finally, we thoroughly investigate the generalizability and explainability of our proposed ALC-ITR system in providing explanations and preliminary diagnosis reports given retrieved patient cases (conditioned on anatomical regions), with proper off-the-shelf LLM prompts.",

We show in addition, that the speed of propagation for this mode vanishes, indicating the presence of another type of strong coupling. To further investigate this, we extend our analysis to the Bianchi Type I Universe, with the most general solution for the vector field.

However, current understanding of algorithm design primitives for computationally efficient exploration with language models is limited. To better understand how to leverage access to powerful pre-trained generative models to improve the efficiency of exploration, we introduce a new computational framework for RL with language models, in which the learner interacts with the model through a sampling oracle. Focusing on the linear softmax model parameterization, we provide new results that reveal the computational-statistical tradeoffs of efficient exploration: 1. Necessity of coverage: Coverage refers to the extent to which the pre-trained model covers near-optimal responses -- a form of hidden knowledge. We show that coverage, while not necessary for data efficiency, lower bounds the runtime of any algorithm in our framework. 2. Inference-time exploration: We introduce a new algorithm, SpannerSampling, which obtains optimal data efficiency and is computationally efficient whenever the pre-trained model enjoys sufficient coverage, matching our lower bound. SpannerSampling leverages inference-time computation with the pre-trained model to reduce the effective search space for exploration. 3. Insufficiency of training-time interventions: We contrast the result above by showing that training-time interventions that produce proper policies cannot achieve similar guarantees in polynomial time. 4. Computational benefits of multi-turn exploration: Finally, we show that under additional representational assumptions, one can achieve improved runtime (replacing sequence-level coverage with token-level coverage) through multi-turn exploration.",

        "summary": "Knowing the sea surface velocity field is essential for various applications, such as search and rescue operations and oil spill monitoring, where understanding the movement of objects or substances is critical. However, obtaining an accurate approximation of these advection processes is challenging, even with modern measuring equipment, such as high-frequency radar or advanced simulations based on oceanic flow models. Therefore this paper presents a data-driven framework to approximate sea surface velocity from spatially distributed observations, thus enabling efficient probability advection modeling across submesoscale domains. The system approximates transient flows by leveraging quasi-steady flow assumptions. To overcome the limitations of point measurements in capturing domain-wide circulation, the method employs a fusion of two simplified 2D flow models to approximate submesoscale dynamics, enabling complete velocity field reconstruction from scattered data. To ensure reliable flow dynamics, the approach iteratively adjusts boundary conditions in numerical simulations to align the simulated flow with observations. Experimental validation in Kvarner Bay using GPS-tracked drifters confirmed the system's ability to replace computationally intensive transient simulations by approximating flow fields based on model simplifications. The results demonstrate its efficiency across domains, making it a practical tool for real-world submesoscale applications requiring swift passive scalar advection.",

In particular, low oxygen levels (hypoxia) activate the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor(HIF) pathway which has an array of target systems. One of these systems is Integrin-Linked Kinase (ILK) pathway, which influences key signaling pathways for cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Hence, this paper aimed to explore the interconnection between these two pathways. Using the Petri net modeling tool Snoopy, an established HIF network model was transformed to be a continuous Petri net. Subsequently, the network was expanded to incorporate a feedback element from the ILK pathway to HIF, based on gene expression data. The resulting model conserved the oxygen switch response of the original HIF model and positively amplified HIF's output. Therefore, this model provides a starting point for establishing a system reflecting crucial effect on hypoxia-induced cancer behavior, and could potentially serve as a basis for future drug development.",

These lead to various peculiar phenomena, one of which being the piston effect where a sudden heating induces a mechanical pulse. The coupling between thermal and mechanical processes, in the linear approximation, yields a non-trivially rich thermoacoustics. The numerous applications of supercritical fluids raise the need for reliable yet fast and efficient numerical solution for thermoacoustic time and space dependence in this sensitive domain. Here, we present a second-order accurate, fully explicit staggered space-time grid finite difference method for such coupled linear thermoacoustic problems. Time integration is based on the splitting of the state space vector field representing the interactions that affect the dynamics into reversible and irreversible parts, which splitting procedure leads to decoupled wave and heat equations. The former is a hyperbolic partial differential equation, while the latter is a parabolic one, therefore, different time integration algorithms must be amalgamated to obtain a reliable, dispersion error-free, and dissipation error-free numerical solution. Finally, the thermoacoustic approximation of the supercritical piston effect is investigated via the developed method.",

Each day, each vertex updates its color following the majority among its neighbors, using its previous color for tie-breaking. The dynamics achieves \\textit{unanimity} if every vertex has the same color after finitely many days, and such color is said to \\textit{win}. When $G$ is a $G(n,p)$ random graph, L. Tran and Vu (2019) found a codition in terms of $p$ and the initial difference $2\\Delta$ beteween the sizes of the Red and Blue camps, such that unanimity is achieved with probability arbitrarily close to 1. They showed that if $p\\Delta^2 \\gg1 $, $p\\Delta \\geq 100$, and $p\\geq (1+\\varepsilon) n^{-1}\\log n$ for a positive constant $\\varepsilon$, then unanimity occurs with probability $1 - o(1)$. If $p$ is not extremely small, namely $p > \\log^{-1/16} n $, then Sah and Sawhney (2022) showed that the condition $p\\Delta^2 \\gg 1$ is sufficient. If $n^{-1}\\log^2 n \\ll p \\ll n^{-1/2}\\log^{1/4} n$, we show that $p^{3/2}\\Delta \\gg n^{-1/2}\\log n$ is enough. Since this condition holds if $p\\Delta \\geq 100$ for $p$ in this range, this is an improvement of Tran's and Vu's result. For the closely related problem of finding the optimal condition for $p$ to achieve unanimity when the initial coloring is chosen uniformly at random among all possible Red/Blue assignments, our result implies a new lower bound $p \\gg n^{-2/3}\\log^{2/3} n$, which improves upon the previous bound of $n^{-3/5}\\log n$ by Chakraborti, Kim, Lee and T.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that EigenGS not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to direct 2D Gaussian fitting but also reduces necessary parameter count and training time.

SpliCER is compatible with any self-supervised loss function and can be integrated into existing methods without modification. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: i) we demonstrate that existing self-supervised methods can learn shortcut solutions when simple and complex features are both present; ii) we introduce a novel self-supervised training method, SpliCER, to overcome the limitations of existing methods, and achieve significant downstream performance improvements; iii) we demonstrate the effectiveness of SpliCER in cutting-edge medical and geospatial imaging settings.

To understand this effect quantitatively, we measure quasiparticle fluctuations and extract the quasiparticle density across different temperatures, readout powers, and resonator volumes. We find that microwave power generates a higher quasiparticle density as the active resonator volume is reduced and show that this effect sets a sensitivity limit on kinetic inductance detectors. We compare our results with theoretical models of direct microwave photon absorption by quasiparticles and conclude that an unknown, indirect mechanism plays a dominant role in quasiparticle generation.

By extracting the coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, we discover close phonon pairs near 1.3 THz and 3.1 THz, as well as a new mode at 1.84 THz. The 1.3 THz phonon pair and the 1.84 THz mode are observed up to the CDW transition temperature. Combining density-functional theory calculations, we point out these phonon pairs arise from the coexistence of Star-of-David and inverse Star-of-David distortions combined with six-fold rotational symmetry breaking. An anisotropy in the magnitude of transient reflectivity change is also revealed at the onset of CDW order. Our results thus indicate broken six-fold rotational symmetry in the charge-density wave state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, along with the absence of nematic fluctuation above T$_{\\text{CDW}}$. Meanwhile, the measured coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-\\text{x}}$Sn$_\\text{x}$ with x = 0.03-0.04 matches with staggered inverse Star-of-David with interlayer $\\pi$ phase shift.

Although experimental uncertainties today are larger than those of simulations, at the High Luminosity LHC experimental precision is expected to be above the theoretical one for events generated below next-to-leading order (NLO) precision.

Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities, which effectively utilizes image and text representations and facilitates robust cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. DKAM improves category-level alignment, allowing for accurate disease recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition and exhibits the state-of-the-art performance compared to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.",

        "summary": "Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional quantum technologies, enabling applications in metrology, secure communication, and measurement-based quantum computing. So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of approximately -8 dB in the fundamental mode, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest recorded for pulsed squeezing. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links. This work completes the set of capabilities needed for robust multimode squeezed light detection and significantly expands its applicability in quantum technologies.",

        "summary": "Lane topology extraction involves detecting lanes and traffic elements and determining their relationships, a key perception task for mapless autonomous driving. This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by vision-language foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chain-of-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance. We evaluate the method on the OpenLane-V2 dataset, showing consistent improvements across various baseline detectors.

        "summary": "Intracluster light (ICL) provides a record of the dynamical interactions undergone by clusters, giving clues on cluster formation and evolution. Here, we analyse the properties of ICL in the massive cluster Abell 2390 at redshift z=0.228. Our analysis is based on the deep images obtained by the Euclid mission as part of the Early Release Observations in the near-infrared (Y, J, H bands), using the NISP instrument in a 0.75 deg$^2$ field. We subtracted a point--spread function (PSF) model and removed the Galactic cirrus contribution in each band after modelling it with the DAWIS software. We then applied three methods to detect, characterise, and model the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the CICLE 2D multi-galaxy fitting; the DAWIS wavelet-based multiscale software; and a mask-based 1D profile fitting. We detect ICL out to 600 kpc. The ICL fractions derived by our three methods range between 18% and 36% (average of 24%), while the BCG+ICL fractions are between 21% and 41% (average of 29%), depending on the band and method. A galaxy density map based on 219 selected cluster members shows a strong cluster substructure to the south-east and a smaller feature to the north-west. Based on colours, the ICL (out to about 400 kpc) seems to be built by the accretion of small systems (M ~ $10^{9.5}$ solar mass), or from stars coming from the outskirts of Milky Way-type galaxies (M ~ $10^{10}$ solar mass). Though Abell 2390 does not seem to be undergoing a merger, it is not yet fully relaxed, since it has accreted two groups that have not fully merged with the cluster core. We estimate that the contributions to the inner 300 kpc of the ICL of the north-west and south-east subgroups are 21% and 9% respectively.",

Previous attacks often utilize multiple reference models to approximate the conditional score distribution, leading to significant computational overhead. While recent work leverages quantile regression to estimate conditional thresholds, it fails to capture epistemic uncertainty, resulting in bias in low-density regions. In this work, we propose a novel approach - Bayesian Membership Inference Attack (BMIA), which performs conditional attack through Bayesian inference. In particular, we transform a trained reference model into Bayesian neural networks by Laplace approximation, enabling the direct estimation of the conditional score distribution by probabilistic model parameters. Our method addresses both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty with only a reference model, enabling efficient and powerful MIA.

Base on the observation that walking data captures valuable movement patterns transferable across tasks and, on the other hand, the advanced kinematic methods can generate diverse grasping poses, which can then be interpolated into motions to serve as task-specific guidance. Our approach incorporates an active data generation strategy to maximize the utility of the generated motions, along with a local feature alignment mechanism that transfers natural movement patterns from walking data to enhance both the success rate and naturalness of the synthesized motions. By combining the fidelity and stability of natural walking with the flexibility and generalizability of task-specific generated data, our method demonstrates strong performance and robust adaptability in diverse scenes and with unseen objects.",

A classic study by Taylor (2022) showed that heavy inertial point particles (having density parameter R = 1) are trapped by the flow separatrices when the particle Stokes number St, which measures the particle's inertia, is less than 1/4. Here, we consider finitely dense particles, incorporating the previously neglected effects of added mass and the Boussinesq-Basset history force. Using linear stability analysis near stagnation points, we determine the critical parametric conditions in the St-R plane that leads to particle trapping within vortex cells. We identify additional stagnation points perceived by inertial particles, beyond the traditional ones at vortex cell corners, when the added mass effect is included, and we analyze their stability. Numerical analysis of the full nonlinear system confirms the existence of distinct particle behaviours--trapped, diffusive, and ballistic--depending on initial conditions, consistent with Nath et al. (2024), with modifications due to added mass effect. We delineate the regions in the St-R plane where these behaviours dominate based on the prominent particle dynamics. However, when both the history force and added mass effect are included, all particles exhibit ballistic motion regardless of St and R.",

AI-based approaches appear to be up to the challenge, but in production they must not only achieve high success rates. They must also ensure insertion quality and reliability. To address this, we introduce QBIT, a quality-aware benchmarking framework that incorporates additional metrics such as force energy, force smoothness and completion time to provide a comprehensive assessment. To ensure statistical significance and minimize the sim-to-real gap, we randomize contact parameters in the MuJoCo simulator, account for perceptual uncertainty, and conduct large-scale experiments on a Kubernetes-based infrastructure. Our microservice-oriented architecture ensures extensibility, broad applicability, and improved reproducibility. To facilitate seamless transitions to physical robotic testing, we use ROS2 with containerization to reduce integration barriers. We evaluate QBIT using three insertion approaches: geometricbased, force-based, and learning-based, in both simulated and real-world environments. In simulation, we compare the accuracy of contact simulation using different mesh decomposition techniques. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of QBIT in comparing different insertion approaches and accelerating the transition from laboratory to real-world applications.

        "summary": "Although large visual-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in multimodal tasks, errors may occasionally arise due to biases during the reasoning process. Recently, reward models (RMs) have become increasingly pivotal in the reasoning process. Specifically, process RMs evaluate each reasoning step, outcome RMs focus on the assessment of reasoning results, and critique RMs perform error analysis on the entire reasoning process, followed by corrections. However, existing benchmarks for vision-language RMs (VLRMs) typically assess only a single aspect of their capabilities (e.g., distinguishing between two answers), thus limiting the all-round evaluation and restricting the development of RMs in the visual-language domain. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark, dubbed as VLRMBench, encompassing 12,634 questions. VLRMBench is constructed based on three distinct types of datasets, covering mathematical reasoning, hallucination understanding, and multi-image understanding. We design 12 tasks across three major categories, focusing on evaluating VLRMs in the aspects of process understanding, outcome judgment, and critique generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on 21 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models, highlighting the challenges posed by VLRMBench. For instance, in the `Forecasting Future', a binary classification task, the advanced GPT-4o achieves only a 76.0% accuracy. Additionally, we perform comprehensive analytical studies, offering valuable insights for the future development of VLRMs. We anticipate that VLRMBench will serve as a pivotal benchmark in advancing VLRMs. Code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/JCruan519/VLRMBench.",

In order to understand better the underlying mechanism of plant response to Pi, the response to phosphate starvation in Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated through use of Petri Nets, a formal language suitable for bio-modeling. A. thaliana displays a range of responses to deal with Pi starvation, but special attention was paid to root hair elongation in this study. A central player in the root hair pathway is the transcription factor ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6-LIKE 4 (RSL4), which has been found to be upregulated during the Pi stress. A Petri Net was created which could simulate the gene regulatory networks responsible for the increase in root hair length, as well as the resulting increase in root hair length. Notably, discrepancies between the model and the literature suggested an important role for RSL2 in regulating RSL4. In the future, the net designed in the current study could be used as a platform to develop hypotheses about the interaction between RSL2 and RSL4.",

On the other hand, it often encounters the dilemma among anchor features, model size, and rendering quality - large anchor features lead to large 3D models and high-quality rendering whereas reducing anchor features degrades Gaussian attribute prediction which leads to clear artifacts in the rendered textures and geometries. We design SOGS, an anchor-based 3D-GS technique that introduces second-order anchors to achieve superior rendering quality and reduced anchor features and model size simultaneously. Specifically, SOGS incorporates covariance-based second-order statistics and correlation across feature dimensions to augment features within each anchor, compensating for the reduced feature size and improving rendering quality effectively. In addition, it introduces a selective gradient loss to enhance the optimization of scene textures and scene geometries, leading to high-quality rendering with small anchor features. Extensive experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks show that SOGS achieves superior rendering quality in novel view synthesis with clearly reduced model size.",

To this end, we propose an estimator of KL divergence which is based on the von Mises expansion. Our closeness test attains optimal parametric rates under smoothness assumptions. Equipped with this test, which serves as a building block of our causal discovery algorithm to identify the causal structure between two multidimensional random variables, we establish sample complexity guarantees for our causal discovery method.

The essential prerequisite to understanding the microscopic mechanisms of this complex electronic landscape is to unveil the configuration and symmetry of the charge-density wave order. As to now, little consensus has been made on what symmetry is broken. Herein, we clarify the microscopic structure and symmetry breaking of the CDW phase in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity. Our approach is based on extracting coherent phonon spectra induced by three-dimensional CDW and comparing them to calculated phonon frequencies via density-functional theory. The combination of these experimental results and calculations provides compelling evidence that the CDW structure of both compounds prevailing up to T$_{\\text{CDW}}$ is the 2 $\\times$ 2 $\\times$ 2 staggered inverse Star-of-David pattern with interlayer $\\pi$ phase shift, in which the six-fold rotational symmetry is broken.

This study presents an advanced evaluation of the developed open-source fabrication software Augmented Carpentry (AC), focusing on the technical challenges, potential bottlenecks, and precision of the proposed system, which is designed to recognize both objects and tools. In the workflow, computer vision tools and sensors implement inside-out tracking techniques for the retrofitting tools. This method enables operators to perform precise saw-cutting and drilling tasks using computer-generated feedback. In the design and manufacturing process pipeline, manual fabrication tasks are performed directly from the computer-aided design environment, as computer numerical control machines are widely used in the timber construction industry. Traditional non-digital methods employing execution drawings, markings, and jigs can now be replaced, and manual labor can be directly integrated into the digital value chain. First, this paper introduces the developed methodology and explains its devices and functional phases in detail. Second, the fabrication methodology is evaluated by experimentally scanning the produced one-to-one scale mock-up elements and comparing the discrepancies with their respective three-dimensional execution models.

Recent works have also advocated for utilizing this high sampling bandwidth to fit-in multiple MIMO streams, and reduce the number of ADCs required to build MIMO base-stations. This can potentially reduce the cost of Massive MIMO RUs, since ADCs are the most expensive electronics in the base-station radio chain. However, these recent works do not model the necessary decimation filters that exist in the signal path of these high sampling rate ADCs. We show in this short paper that because of the decimation filters, there can be introduction of cross-talks which can hinder the performance of these shared ADC interfaces. We simulate the shared ADC interface with Matlab 5G toolbox for uplink MIMO, and show that these cross-talks can be mitigated by performing MMSE equalization atop the PUSCH estimated channels.",

Recent open-set methods leverage text prompts, visual cues, or prompt-free paradigm to overcome this, but often compromise between performance and efficiency due to high computational demands or deployment complexity. In this work, we introduce YOLOE, which integrates detection and segmentation across diverse open prompt mechanisms within a single highly efficient model, achieving real-time seeing anything. For text prompts, we propose Re-parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) strategy. It refines pretrained textual embeddings via a re-parameterizable lightweight auxiliary network and enhances visual-textual alignment with zero inference and transferring overhead. For visual prompts, we present Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE). It employs decoupled semantic and activation branches to bring improved visual embedding and accuracy with minimal complexity. For prompt-free scenario, we introduce Lazy Region-Prompt Contrast (LRPC) strategy. It utilizes a built-in large vocabulary and specialized embedding to identify all objects, avoiding costly language model dependency. Extensive experiments show YOLOE's exceptional zero-shot performance and transferability with high inference efficiency and low training cost.

A particularly insidious form of leakage arises from the fact that hardware consumes power and emits radiation in a manner that is statistically associated with the data it processes and the instructions it executes. Supervised deep learning has emerged as a state-of-the-art tool for carrying out *side-channel attacks*, which exploit this leakage by learning to map power/radiation measurements throughout encryption to the sensitive data operated on during that encryption. In this work we develop a principled deep learning framework for determining the relative leakage due to measurements recorded at different points in time, in order to inform *defense* against such attacks. This information is invaluable to cryptographic hardware designers for understanding *why* their hardware leaks and how they can mitigate it (e.g. by indicating the particular sections of code or electronic components which are responsible). Our framework is based on an adversarial game between a family of classifiers trained to estimate the conditional distributions of sensitive data given subsets of measurements, and a budget-constrained noise distribution which probabilistically erases individual measurements to maximize the loss of these classifiers. We demonstrate our method's efficacy and ability to overcome limitations of prior work through extensive experimental comparison with 8 baseline methods using 3 evaluation metrics and 6 publicly-available power/EM trace datasets from AES, ECC and RSA implementations.

Conventional fault detection methods depend on continuous, high-frequency vibration sensing, digitising, and wireless transmission to the cloud-an approach that significantly drains the limited energy reserves of battery-powered sensors, accelerating their depletion and increasing maintenance costs. This work proposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous vibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to specific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as the key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the machinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital conversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the sensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach, we use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets, examining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also consider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices, and the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested energy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and severities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a diagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance strategy for fault detection in smart machinery.",

We assume that the photovoltaic system is composed of a photovoltaic panel and a battery, where the photovoltaic panel produces energy according to a certain stochastic process. The management of the battery is the responsibility of a group administrator, who makes the joint decision to either store part of the photovoltaic energy production and sell the remaining energy at the electricity spot price, or discharge part of the energy stored in the battery and sell it in the electricity market. Inspired by European Union and Italian legislation, which promote incentives for energy transition and renewable energy production, we assume that the group receives a monetary incentive for the virtual self-consumed energy, defined as the minimum between the power bought from the grid to satisfy the group's power demand and the energy sold to the market. In this case, the energy sold by the group is a mix of part of the photovoltaic production that is not stored and part of the energy discharged from the battery. We model the problem as a stochastic optimal control problem, where the optimal strategy is the joint charge-discharge decision that minimizes the group's energy consumption costs. We find the solution numerically by applying a finite difference scheme to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the value function of the optimal control problem.",

This has the potential to drive and accelerate the energy revolution by utilizing materials that integrate the functionality of batteriesand photovoltaic cells. Finding, optimizing, and customizing these materials is a complex task, though. Computational modeling can play a crucial role in guiding and speeding up these processes, particularly when the atomic mechanisms are not well understood. This does however require expertise in various areas, including advanced electronic-structure theory, machine learning, and multi-scale approaches. In this perspective, we shed light on the intricacies of modeling optoionic effects for solar battery materials. We first discuss the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms, as well as the computational tools that are available to date for describing these processes. Furthermore, we discuss the limits of these approaches and identify key challenges that need to be tackled to advance this field.",

This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints.

However conventional ITR systems typically only rely on global image or text representations for measuring patient image/report similarities, which overlook local distinctiveness across patient cases. This often results in suboptimal retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose an Anatomical Location-Conditioned Image-Text Retrieval (ALC-ITR) framework, which, given a query image and the associated suspicious anatomical region(s), aims to retrieve similar patient cases exhibiting the same disease or symptoms in the same anatomical region. To perform location-conditioned multimodal retrieval, we learn a medical Relevance-Region-Aligned Vision Language (RRA-VL) model with semantic global-level and region-/word-level alignment to produce generalizable, well-aligned multi-modal representations. Additionally, we perform location-conditioned contrastive learning to further utilize cross-pair region-level contrastiveness for improved multi-modal retrieval. We show that our proposed RRA-VL achieves state-of-the-art localization performance in phase-grounding tasks, and satisfying multi-modal retrieval performance with or without location conditioning. Finally, we thoroughly investigate the generalizability and explainability of our proposed ALC-ITR system in providing explanations and preliminary diagnosis reports given retrieved patient cases (conditioned on anatomical regions), with proper off-the-shelf LLM prompts.",

In this article, we investigate the effect of high processor connectivity on average two qubit gate fidelity in a cavity based architecture with tunable coupling. Via a perturbative approach, we quantify the cross-talk errors from transverse residual couplings and show that they scale as $nm^2$ where $n$ is the number of idle qubits and $m$ is the ratio between the transverse residual and active couplings. Setting an error threshold $E_\\mathrm{thr}$, we demonstrate that cross-talks restrict the hardware topology and prevent the full use of all-to-all connectivity.

We show in addition, that the speed of propagation for this mode vanishes, indicating the presence of another type of strong coupling. To further investigate this, we extend our analysis to the Bianchi Type I Universe, with the most general solution for the vector field. We show that the extra degree of freedom remains in the theory. Among the modes, we further show that the mode with vanishing speed of propagation is still present, pointing to the strong coupling.

However, current understanding of algorithm design primitives for computationally efficient exploration with language models is limited. To better understand how to leverage access to powerful pre-trained generative models to improve the efficiency of exploration, we introduce a new computational framework for RL with language models, in which the learner interacts with the model through a sampling oracle. Focusing on the linear softmax model parameterization, we provide new results that reveal the computational-statistical tradeoffs of efficient exploration: 1. Necessity of coverage: Coverage refers to the extent to which the pre-trained model covers near-optimal responses -- a form of hidden knowledge. We show that coverage, while not necessary for data efficiency, lower bounds the runtime of any algorithm in our framework. 2. Inference-time exploration: We introduce a new algorithm, SpannerSampling, which obtains optimal data efficiency and is computationally efficient whenever the pre-trained model enjoys sufficient coverage, matching our lower bound. SpannerSampling leverages inference-time computation with the pre-trained model to reduce the effective search space for exploration. 3. Insufficiency of training-time interventions: We contrast the result above by showing that training-time interventions that produce proper policies cannot achieve similar guarantees in polynomial time. 4. Computational benefits of multi-turn exploration: Finally, we show that under additional representational assumptions, one can achieve improved runtime (replacing sequence-level coverage with token-level coverage) through multi-turn exploration.",

However, obtaining an accurate approximation of these advection processes is challenging, even with modern measuring equipment, such as high-frequency radar or advanced simulations based on oceanic flow models. Therefore this paper presents a data-driven framework to approximate sea surface velocity from spatially distributed observations, thus enabling efficient probability advection modeling across submesoscale domains. The system approximates transient flows by leveraging quasi-steady flow assumptions. To overcome the limitations of point measurements in capturing domain-wide circulation, the method employs a fusion of two simplified 2D flow models to approximate submesoscale dynamics, enabling complete velocity field reconstruction from scattered data. To ensure reliable flow dynamics, the approach iteratively adjusts boundary conditions in numerical simulations to align the simulated flow with observations. Experimental validation in Kvarner Bay using GPS-tracked drifters confirmed the system's ability to replace computationally intensive transient simulations by approximating flow fields based on model simplifications. The results demonstrate its efficiency across domains, making it a practical tool for real-world submesoscale applications requiring swift passive scalar advection.",

Hence, this paper aimed to explore the interconnection between these two pathways. Using the Petri net modeling tool Snoopy, an established HIF network model was transformed to be a continuous Petri net. Subsequently, the network was expanded to incorporate a feedback element from the ILK pathway to HIF, based on gene expression data. The resulting model conserved the oxygen switch response of the original HIF model and positively amplified HIF's output. Therefore, this model provides a starting point for establishing a system reflecting crucial effect on hypoxia-induced cancer behavior, and could potentially serve as a basis for future drug development.",

These lead to various peculiar phenomena, one of which being the piston effect where a sudden heating induces a mechanical pulse. The coupling between thermal and mechanical processes, in the linear approximation, yields a non-trivially rich thermoacoustics. The numerous applications of supercritical fluids raise the need for reliable yet fast and efficient numerical solution for thermoacoustic time and space dependence in this sensitive domain. Here, we present a second-order accurate, fully explicit staggered space-time grid finite difference method for such coupled linear thermoacoustic problems. Time integration is based on the splitting of the state space vector field representing the interactions that affect the dynamics into reversible and irreversible parts, which splitting procedure leads to decoupled wave and heat equations. The former is a hyperbolic partial differential equation, while the latter is a parabolic one, therefore, different time integration algorithms must be amalgamated to obtain a reliable, dispersion error-free, and dissipation error-free numerical solution. Finally, the thermoacoustic approximation of the supercritical piston effect is investigated via the developed method.",

The dynamics achieves \\textit{unanimity} if every vertex has the same color after finitely many days, and such color is said to \\textit{win}. When $G$ is a $G(n,p)$ random graph, L. Tran and Vu (2019) found a codition in terms of $p$ and the initial difference $2\\Delta$ beteween the sizes of the Red and Blue camps, such that unanimity is achieved with probability arbitrarily close to 1. They showed that if $p\\Delta^2 \\gg1 $, $p\\Delta \\geq 100$, and $p\\geq (1+\\varepsilon) n^{-1}\\log n$ for a positive constant $\\varepsilon$, then unanimity occurs with probability $1 - o(1)$. If $p$ is not extremely small, namely $p > \\log^{-1/16} n $, then Sah and Sawhney (2022) showed that the condition $p\\Delta^2 \\gg 1$ is sufficient. If $n^{-1}\\log^2 n \\ll p \\ll n^{-1/2}\\log^{1/4} n$, we show that $p^{3/2}\\Delta \\gg n^{-1/2}\\log n$ is enough. Since this condition holds if $p\\Delta \\geq 100$ for $p$ in this range, this is an improvement of Tran's and Vu's result. For the closely related problem of finding the optimal condition for $p$ to achieve unanimity when the initial coloring is chosen uniformly at random among all possible Red/Blue assignments, our result implies a new lower bound $p \\gg n^{-2/3}\\log^{2/3} n$, which improves upon the previous bound of $n^{-3/5}\\log n$ by Chakraborti, Kim, Lee and T.

        "summary": "In this work, we perform ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity measurements to study the symmetry breaking in the charge-density wave (CDW) phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. By extracting the coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, we discover close phonon pairs near 1.3 THz and 3.1 THz, as well as a new mode at 1.84 THz. The 1.3 THz phonon pair and the 1.84 THz mode are observed up to the CDW transition temperature. Combining density-functional theory calculations, we point out these phonon pairs arise from the coexistence of Star-of-David and inverse Star-of-David distortions combined with six-fold rotational symmetry breaking. An anisotropy in the magnitude of transient reflectivity change is also revealed at the onset of CDW order. Our results thus indicate broken six-fold rotational symmetry in the charge-density wave state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, along with the absence of nematic fluctuation above T$_{\\text{CDW}}$. Meanwhile, the measured coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-\\text{x}}$Sn$_\\text{x}$ with x = 0.03-0.04 matches with staggered inverse Star-of-David with interlayer $\\pi$ phase shift. This CDW structure contrasts with undoped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and explains the evolution from phonon pair to a single mode at 1.3 THz by x = 0.03-0.04 Sn-doping.",

We also state a conjecture extending this to an $A _{\\infty}$ functor from the exact path category of the space of monotone Lagrangian branes to the Fukaya category. Quantum Maslov classes are used here for the study of Hofer geometry of Lagrangian equators in $S ^{2}$, giving a rigidity phenomenon for the Hofer metric 2-systole, which stands in contrast to the flexibility phenomenon of the closely related Hofer metric girth studied by Rauch ~\\cite{cite_Itamar}, in the same context of Lagrangian equators of $S ^{2}$. More applications appear in ~\\cite{cite_SavelyevGlobalFukayacategoryII}.",

        "summary": "As the quality of experimental measurements increases, so does the need for Monte Carlo-generated simulated events - both with respect to the total amount and to their precision. In perturbative methods, this involves the evaluation of higher order corrections to the leading order (LO) scattering amplitudes, including real emissions and loop corrections. Although experimental uncertainties today are larger than those of simulations, at the High Luminosity LHC experimental precision is expected to be above the theoretical one for events generated below next-to-leading order (NLO) precision. As forecasted hardware resources will not meet CPU requirements for these simulation needs, speeding up NLO event generation is a necessity. In recent years, collaborators across Europe and the United States have been working on CPU vectorisation of LO event generation within the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework, as well as porting it to GPUs, to major success. Recently, development has also started on vectorising NLO event generation. Due to the more complicated nature of NLO amplitudes this development faces several difficulties not accounted for in the LO development, but it shows promise. Here, we present these issues as well as the current status of our event-parallel NLO implementation.",

        "summary": "This work presents a computationally efficient approach to data-driven robust contracting controller synthesis for polynomial control-affine systems based on a sum-of-squares program. In particular, we consider the case in which a system alternates between periods of high-quality sensor data and low-quality sensor data. In the high-quality sensor data regime, we focus on robust system identification based on the data informativity framework. In low-quality sensor data regimes we employ a robustly contracting controller that is synthesized online by solving a sum-of-squares program based on data acquired in the high-quality regime, so as to limit state deviation until high-quality data is available. This approach is motivated by real-life control applications in which systems experience periodic data blackouts or occlusion, such as autonomous vehicles undergoing loss of GPS signal or solar glare in machine vision systems. We apply our approach to a planar unmanned aerial vehicle model subject to an unknown wind field, demonstrating its uses for verifiably tight control on trajectory deviation.",

        "summary": "Cloud computing offers flexibility in resource provisioning, allowing an organization to host its batch processing workloads cost-efficiently by dynamically scaling the size and composition of a cloud-based cluster -- a collection of instances provisioned from the cloud. However, existing schedulers fail to minimize total cost due to suboptimal task and instance scheduling strategies, interference between co-located tasks, and instance provisioning overheads. We present Eva, a scheduler for cloud-based clusters that reduces the overall cost of hosting long-running batch jobs. Eva leverages reservation price from economics to derive the optimal set of instances to provision and task-to-instance assignments. Eva also takes into account performance degradation when co-locating tasks and quantitatively evaluates the trade-off between short-term migration overhead and long-term provision savings when considering a change in cluster configuration. Experiments on AWS EC2 and large-scale trace-driven simulations demonstrate that Eva reduces costs by 42\\% while incurring only a 15\\% increase in JCT, compared to provisioning a separate instance for each task.",
