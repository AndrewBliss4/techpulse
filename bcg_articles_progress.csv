"What 1,000 Farmers Told Us About Tech Adoption","November 14, 2024","US farm owners and managers are often skeptical ofnew technologysolutions that are supposed to improve farm economics by maximizing yields, for example, or reducing the need for manual labor—and with some reason. Many growers have been disappointed by solutions that overpromised and underdelivered.

Adopting a leading-edge technology solution can also add risk for what is often a low-margin industry that contends with economic challenges. Farm owners and managers have only a handful of opportunities each year to turn their crops into cash. Faced with weak agricultural commodity prices and high interest rates, US growers are more inclined than ever to purchase technology solutions that they know and trust, rather than take a chance on something new.

So, how canagribusinessplayers better engage with growers and get traction for their innovations? To answer this question, we partnered withAg Accessto survey roughly 1,000 US growers.

We found that agribusiness companies could do more to consider the individuals behind each purchasing decision. By taking a more granular approach and identifying the factors that motivate different types of buyers, agribusiness players could develop more effective go-to-market strategies and position their product development pipelines to align with customers’ diverse needs.

To understand what drives growers’ purchasing decisions about agriculture technology solutions, we surveyed owners and managers of farms larger than 250 acres across the US that primarily produce corn, soy, wheat, or cotton. We asked participants about ten technology solutions. Each solution had a high degree of awareness among growers, although the newer ones had far lower adoption rates than more established solutions had.

When we asked growers about their buying intentions for 2024, most said that they are planning to repurchase the technology solutions that they have used before rather than try new ones. Of the more nascent technology solutions, growers are most likely to try precision application equipment for the first time. (See Exhibit 1.)","growers(8), solutions(7), technology(6), farm(3), owners(3), managers(3), high(2), rates(2), new(2), ones(2), try(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/what-1000-farmers-told-us-about-tech-adoption
Winning the Tech Race in Africa: Lessons from Digital Natives,"November 11, 2024","In an era when digital technology and analytics are rapidly disrupting most industries, many large African companies in sectors such as financial services, telecom, insurance, and retail are heavily investing to build digital consumer value propositions centred around apps and ecosystems.

A key motivation is often that consumer needs, preferences, expectations, and habits are shifting rapidly. Modern consumers seek comprehensive solutions rather than merely purchasing products. Companies need to evolve how they serve their customers and move towards more integrated, user-centric digital solutions. They are rewarded with growth if they succeed. Examples include FNB’s banking app for consumers and small enterprises, Shoprite’s Sixty60 delivery service, and Luno’s investment platform for cryptocurrency.

Companies also aim to create new revenue streams through innovative business models and novel customer service approaches. M-Pesa and Mobile Money (MoMo) have revolutionized payments in many African countries and created new lines of business for the telecom companies that started them. Discovery, an insurance company, has been successful with Discovery Bank.

Another important factor is the fear of losing direct relationships with customers to intermediaries. By building digital offerings, companies aim to maintain control over customer interactions. Importantly, customer data allows them to tailor their offerings, drive higher revenues, and reduce attrition by increasing engagement. Insurance is an example: incumbent players are investing in direct-to-consumer offerings, such as Naked (Hollard), MiWay (Santam), and Pineapple (Old Mutual).

In some other markets this has already played out. The companies with the best data and the most effective ways of gaining insight from it are emerging as the winners. Global examples include Netflix, which transformed itself from a DVD-by-mail business into a data-driven entertainment platform, and PingAn, a Chinese insurer which adopted a highly successful digital-first business model.

However, many African companies have struggled to achieve good returns on their digital investments. Often, user interest in and uptake of their digital solutions have been lacklustre. Even when new digital offerings attract a significant number of users, the costs associated with inorganic customer acquisition (e.g. through advertising or incentives) often prove unsustainable, making it difficult to achieve favourable long-term per-user economics.

At the heart of these struggles is often a lack of product-market-fit. Many digital solutions are developed with a “solution forward” mindset, where companies start with a specific vision of what the offering should be. This is only natural. Established companies have important assets like technology, data, expertise, brand, and a customer base which can give them an “unfair advantage” over start-ups, and they seek to leverage these to their maximum potential.

However, once solutions are developed in this way, the value proposition often fails to resonate with customers. Users may try the new offering but fail to adopt it organically because it is too difficult to use, the value proposition is unclear, the addressed need is not pressing enough, or an easier alternative is available.

To improve their chances of launching successful digital solutions and to avoid sinking large amounts of funding into ultimately unsuccessful ventures, African companies could learn from digital-native companies that have successfully introduced and scaled digital consumer value propositions. These companies, often found in hotspots like Silicon Valley and Shenzhen, share some characteristics that contribute to their success. There are three common themes:

Emulating these three traits is not trivial. It generally requires profound changes in a company’s operating and governance models, culture, ways of working, and employee value propositions. This can be particularly challenging if companies need to unlearn some of the habits and patterns which have made them successful previously, such as:

These are not easy changes to make. They often present management teams with uncomfortable choices. But the rewards are enormous: African companies that can adopt and embrace digital-native characteristics greatly improve the odds of transforming their businesses, establishing new sources of competitive advantage and, in some cases, achieving a step-change in their valuations.

What Cybersecurity Leaders Get Right,"October 15, 2024","Chief information security officers face a continually evolving challenge. The threat landscape is changing all the time, requiring unrelenting vigilance. Yet even as CISOs seek to enhance their company’s security posture, they must deal with talent shortages and competing budget priorities. To better understand these issues, BCG recently partnered with GLG, a research firm that primarily serves the financial industry, to survey more than 350cybersecurityleaders from companies around the world.11The survey was conducted in June 2024. Respondents were from companies in a range of sizes and a variety of geographic markets and industries. This was BCG’s second annual cybersecurity survey;the firstwas conducted in 2023.Notes:1The survey was conducted in June 2024. Respondents were from companies in a range of sizes and a variety of geographic markets and industries. This was BCG’s second annual cybersecurity survey;the firstwas conducted in 2023.

Key takeaways from our analysis include the following:

These findings offer critical insights for cybersecurity executives, investors (including PE firms), and vendors.

In our survey, companies assessed themselves on how effectively they have adopted 12 best practices in cybersecurity, from data protection to incident response and third-party cyber risk management. Overall, company scores increased across most of the 12 areas from 2023 to 2024, indicating that cyber maturity is growing. The biggest gains were in cybersecurity governance, risk, and compliance (an increase of 8 percentage points), driven by growing regulatory pressures and an increased awareness of the importance of internal governance practices. Business continuity and resilience scores also increased, up 8 percentage points.

Despite this progress, some critical gaps remain. For example, only 25% of companies achieved the highest score for app security, and only 22% did so in data protection or software supply chain risk management. (See Exhibit 1.) Third-party cyber risk management is also a core priority, but just 28% of companies achieved the highest score.","survey(6), companies(6), cybersecurity(5), risk(4), security(3), cyber(3), management(3), company(2), june(2), respondents(2), sizes(2), variety(2), geographic(2), markets(2), industries(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/what-cybersecurity-leaders-get-right
"In Today’s 5G World, Africa Has an Opportunity To Accelerate","September 23, 2024","In the past three years the world has pivoted sharply. Mid-2021, the global pandemic was receding, inflation and interest rates were low, ChatGPT hadn’t been released, there was no war in Europe and a peace accord in the Middle East was tantalizingly close.

Fast-forward to today and the global environment looks completely different. Companies, governments, and NGOs are all looking for ways to navigate it and manage a fresh set of challenges, fromGeopoliticsto theGreentransition, the rapid evolution ofGenAI, Government indebtedness, declining populations, andGeneration Alpha. This is what we call the “5G world”.

Many solutions to the 5G challenges will be found in Africa. While the continent still faces undeniable challenges, not the least being the region most impacted by the impact of climate change, it also has massive renewable energy potential. it holds 40% of the critical minerals to transition from a carbon-dependent economy; its arable lands can give the world food security; the Congo Basin and African lands have massive carbon sequestration potential; and the continent will have a 2.5 billion-young population by 2050, a tremendous human capital.

Geopolitics:With the start of the Ukraine war, the US-China decoupling and the Middle East crisis, geopolitics moved into the boardroom of companies. Bismark famously said that nations have no friends, they only have strategic interests. The current global fragmentation that has emerged over the past three years is a real opportunity for African countries. They have never had so much freedom to choose who they do business with. Africa can remain geopolitically equidistant and insist on integrated investment roadmaps that includes natural resources, but also biopharma, education, manufacturing, or agriculture. A strong refocus on regional blocks is also an opportunity accelerate the long-awaited economic, commercial, political, and logistic integration of Africa.

GenAI:Many believe this is a technology that will fundamentally alter the march of human economic progress. It is exponential not linear. The main forces behind Africa’s golden decade in early 2000s were mobile phones and internet. Just as the internet opened up knowledge and commerce, GenAI will unlock expertise and productivity. Africa needs a lot more productivity, across sectors and all 54 countries. GenAI innovation is also not confined to the US and China. Countries like the UAE or France are becoming key players. No matter what industry you operate in, today you are de facto a technology company. African government leaders and CEOs can’t afford to be sceptical: they must upskill on GenAI, invest in data centres, bring cloud computing costs down, develop the right regulations and sign partnerships to ensure they do not miss this generational opportunity.

Green:The green revolution is just starting. Africa has a key role to play, but it must be on Africa’s terms. The cost of making the green transition is immense: some estimates put it at $9 trillion a year. This money will have to come from somewhere – and the global private sector is awash in cash today. African governments should pay close attention to the green policies of other countries and how they can play their part on these new energy value chains. Given how Africa will be impacted by climate change, a priority focus should be on adaptation and resilience. In Africa more than anywhere else, Green starts with Food and Agriculture, Africa’s single most important investment opportunity. One-third of all food produced in Africa is either wasted or lost. The percentage of agricultural land under irrigation in Africa is 1.5%, compared with 15-20% in Asia. The continent still imports $100 billions of food every year. The call to action is clear: invest in crops, custom fertilizers, storage facilities, processing units, transport, and integrated logistics. Energy is another urgent need: 600 million Africans lack access to energy. Electricity is a true game-changer in development. As with mobile technology, Africa can leapfrog yesterday’s energy systems and bet big on renewables, mini-grids, advanced geothermal, biomass and potentially small/medium nuclear reactors.

Global debt:Over the past few decades, the level of public debt has been rising all over the world. That was supercharged by the pandemic. While there is not a lot of money in public coffers, there is a lot in private purses: sovereign wealth funds, private equity funds, large family offices or big corporates. Africa’s development will be capital-intensive, so it needs new ways to mobilise public and private capital. What do private investors want? They say they want Africa to show a few years of macro stability and regulatory certainty. They want to see a larger pipeline of bankable projects, less forex volatility, more liquidity in capital markets, well-run portfolio assets, better governance, and accountability from public officials. They basically want the conditions in place to make a good return. This is how Africa can reduce its high-risk premiums, which is today higher than actual observed risks. Africa should also continue to push for a reset of the global debt and credit multilateral system. With the youngest population and the most growth upside, it is unfortunately the most capital constrained. Africa should be able to run deficits and rely on debt to fund its next stage development. The rest of the world must consider this when they renegotiate multilateral agreements.

Generation Alpha:In five years, 50% of all Africans will be Generation Alpha (born after 2010) or put another way, one-third of Generation Alpha in the world will live in Africa. Not only does the continent have a significant capital shortage, but it also has a massive labour surplus. This is an amazing demographic dividend, and Africa should not waste it. The call to action is first and foremost to invest in education and job creation. And dare to invest in worldclass higher education. A standout example is Morocco, where several world-class universities have opened in the last 10 years, such as UM6P, one of Africa’s most ambitious endeavours. Moroccan digital skills are now so good that BCG has decided to de-localise one of its biggest AI hubs there. Another key aspect of Generation Alpha is to unleash the power of women on the continent, particularly their entrepreneurial power. Corporates have a big role to play in changing mindsets on this dimension. Finally, Africa can export its soft power and youth creative industries to the world: there is global appetite today for African culture whether in food, fashion, arts, sports or music.

Africa has gone through challenging times since the pandemic. But we believe it is Africa’s time to seize advantage in this “5G” world. We are in the middle of a major geopolitical and macroeconomic reset, with profound economic and societal implications. This creates a unique window of opportunity for Africa, where a bold course of action is required. Parts of the continent are close to the moment of achieving escape velocity, from which there will be no turning back. This year, 12 of the 20 fastest-growing countries in the world will be in Africa. There are many positive developments on the continent which are being ignored and overlooked. It is up to African government and business leaders to set a bold agenda for the years to come.

It’s Time to Implement New Tools to Counter Quantum Hacking,"September 10, 2024","Right now, the US Department of Commerce wants businesses to transition to the new encryption tools it has designed to withstand cyberattacks from quantum computers.

As the power of quantum computers advances, they will have the compute power to quickly decode the current encryption methods that keep 98% of electronic data safe.

There is a 50:50 chance of quantum computers being able to do this by 2031, according to BCG analysis in conjunction with the Institute for Quantum Computing.

And although this is a future threat, hackers could be downloading data now to decrypt it later.

“The risk is real and the risk is now, and that’s why these new tools have been launched preemptively,”explains BCG’s Managing Director and PartnerMatt Langione, an expert in quantum computing.

Quantum computinghas the potential to drive huge progress in areas such as drug discovery, optimization of logistics networks, machine learning to detect fraud, and securing government data. And BCG estimates that it will create value totaling $450–$850 billion by the time the technology matures.

Despite this huge potential, quantum computers also threaten two types of encrypted data:

Given the risk of data at rest being downloaded now to decrypt later, the US Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is encouraging computer system administrators to begin transitioning to the new standards it has designedas soon as possible.

NIST has spent eight years working with the private sector and academics around the world to develop the new tools—or cryptographic algorithms.

“These new algorithms are an important milestone because NIST typically sets the standard for common adoption,” Langione says.

“The key question is whether companies will act soon enough to protect themselves against something which might not seem a clear and present danger.”

In the past, cryptographic upgrades have taken about 20 years, although 7–10 years is considered an optimistic minimum today. And even NIST suggests that the transition may well be expensive and disruptive, albeit highly effective.

Here are some initial steps for companies to take:

Inventorizeall hardware, firmware, software, operation systems, and applications that use the current algorithm for encryption. Automated discovery tools can help here.

Prioritizethe components that need to be migrated first based on risk management methodology that assess the sensitivity of thedataand the potential impact of the attack. This will provide a roadmap for action.

Integrateand testthe new standards. Detailed instructions for incorporating the new tools into products and encryption systems will be needed. And they should then be tested to ensure they are functioning correctly and securely, without too much of a negative impact on performance.

Trainkey security personnel and equip them for ongoing monitoring and updating. There should also be collaboration with vendors to ensure they are adopting the new standards too since many attacks happen with software from a third party.

Winning Strategies for B2B SaaS Companies,"September 10, 2024","The tech sector has experienced slowing growth and well-publicized restructurings by global leaders, but one category remains extremely resilient: B2B SaaS players. The sector continued to thrive in 2023, thanks to sustained innovation and strong demand from enterprise customers.

For the second year, BCG X surveyed more than 100 B2B SaaS providers in Europe to understand their current growth prospects, fundamental challenges, andmarketing and salespriorities. (See “A Profile of Participants.”) The initial study showedstrong growth among B2B SaaS players in Europe, and this year’s analysis confirmed sustained growth amid a significantly different market landscape. To help companies capture that potential, we developed a playbook centered on four priorities that leading players are applying: target new customers more effectively, automate marketing processes, link pricing to products, and continue to innovate.

Our research base this year consists of 101 companies, 86% of which are backed by VCs. Collectively, they have raised more than €3 billion. Most of the companies were founded two to five years ago, with an average age of 4.8 years. Among the survey participants, 39% offer industry-specific vertical solutions, while 18% provide horizontal solutions (such as customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning, or human capital management). In terms of country distribution, Germany has the highest share (56%), followed by the UK (15%), the Netherlands (7%), and France (6%).

Although funding for SaaS companies has dropped, growth in the category is still significant: 19% annually in 2023 for the overall industry and 187% for the select group of 101 hypergrowth companies in our sample. The outlook for 2024 is even more positive, with growth of 235% projected.

SaaS companies can scale up quickly, but the competition is fierce. Digitization and cost pressure lead to soaring demand from enterprise customers. Winning products can catch on extremely rapidly, resulting in hypergrowth among top performers.

Of all software segments we analyzed, HR showed the fastest growth, as companies seek to better manage human capital, address issues such as remote and flexible work, andcompete for talentin a competitive market.

GenAI and the New Customer Service Operating Model,"September 06, 2024","While the scaling of use cases has dominated the headlines aboutgenerative AI(GenAI), leading customer service organizations are working to harness the technology’s full potential by fundamentally transforming their operating models.

Their goal is to make the customer service experience faster, more flexible, more customer friendly, and more proactive. These organizations believe that transforming their teams––how they work together, what kind of work they do, and how they are supported and motivated––will help them to realize ambitions for productivity improvements that reach as high as 80%. That goal lies well beyond the 15% to 30% that some organizations have achieved by scaling their initial GenAI use cases to date.

Our experience shows that such ambitious transformations will require more than additional AI-driven assistants and copilots, greater task automation, and improvements to technology and infrastructure. In line with BCG’s10/20/70 rule, a full-scale operational transformation will account for 70% of the effort to harness GenAI’s full potential, with 10% focused on algorithms and 20% on data and the technology backbone.

Exhibit 1 shows the scope of a full GenAI transformation process across customer service operations, which covers the different ways that an organization can solve a customer’s problem, from upstream prevention to outsourced service delivery.","customer(5), service(4), genai(3), organizations(3), technology(3), full(3), use(2), cases(2), harness(2), potential(2), goal(2), experience(2), work(2), improvements(2), transformation(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/transforming-customer-service-operations-with-genai
GenAI Doesn’t Just Increase Productivity. It Expands Capabilities.,"September 05, 2024","This is the second major field experiment led by the BCG Henderson Institute designed to help business leaders understand how humans and GenAI should collaborate in the workplace. Our previous study assessed thevalue created—and destroyed—by GenAIwhen used by workers for tasks they had the capabilities to complete on their own. Our latest experiment tests how workers can use GenAI to complete tasks that are beyond their current capabilities.

A new type of knowledge worker is entering the global talent pool. This employee, augmented withgenerative AI, can write code faster, create personalized marketing content with a single prompt, and summarize hundreds of documents in seconds.

These are impressive productivity gains. But as the nature of many jobs and the skills required to do them evolve, workers will need to expand their current capabilities. Can GenAI be a solution there as well?

Based on the results ofa new experimentconducted by the BCG Henderson Institute and scholars from Boston University and OpenAI’s Economic Impacts research team, the answer is an unequivocal yes. We’ve now found that it’s possible for employees who didn’t have the full know-how to perform a particular task yesterday to use GenAI to complete the same task today.

Our research involved a carefully structured experimental design to evaluate the impact of generative AI on the ability of nontechnical knowledge workers to perform technical, data-science tasks.In total, 480 BCG consultants and 44 BCG data-scientist volunteers completed this controlled study. The study participants were general consultants, for whom data-science expertise is not typically required. This expertise exists among the data scientists of BCG X who also volunteered to support the study by establishing benchmarks. The performance of general consultants was evaluated by comparing their output to that of BCG data scientists who completed the same tasks.General consultants were randomly assigned to either a GenAI-augmented group, which received interactive training on using Enterprise ChatGPT-4 with the Advanced Data Analysis Feature for data science tasks, or a control group, which was asked not to use GenAI and received interactive training on traditional resources like Stack Overflow. The tasks assigned to participants included coding, statistical understanding, and predictive modeling, all of which required skills that are typically outside the expertise of nontechnical workers but within the day-to-day expertise of BCG’s data scientists.Data collection was carried out in four phases: a pre-experiment survey to assess baseline skills and attitudes, a tailored training session for each group, the completion of two out of three randomly assigned data-science tasks, and a post-experiment survey to measure knowledge retention without the use of AI tools.The tasks were designed by BCG data scientists to ensure that they were challenging enough that AI could not solve them independently. Analysis focused on comparing the performance of the treatment and control groups against the benchmarks set by BCG data scientists, examining the completion rates, time taken, and correctness of the responses.Similar to our first GenAI study, we “put our feet to the fire”—with a goal of deeply understanding GenAI’s impact on ways of working.

With that in mind, leaders should embrace GenAI not only as a tool for increasing productivity, but as atechnologythat equips the workforce to meet the changing job demands of today, tomorrow, and beyond. They should consider generative AI an exoskeleton: a tool that empowers workers to perform better, and do more, than either the human or GenAI can on their own.

Of course, there are important caveats—for example, employees may not have the requisite knowledge to check their work, and therefore may not know when the tool has gotten it wrong. Or they may become less attentive in situations where they should be more discriminating.

But leaders who effectively manage the risks can reap significant rewards. The ability to rapidly take on new types of work with GenAI—particularly tasks that traditionally require niche skills that are harder to find, such as data science—can be a game-changer for individuals and companies alike.

In the previous experiment, we measured performance on tasks that were within the realm of the participants’capabilities.11That experiment was conducted using the first version of GPT-4.Notes:1That experiment was conducted using the first version of GPT-4.(See top row of Exhibit 1.) For tasks where GenAIis highly capable, we found that augmented workers perform significantly better than humans working without the technology. However, when the technology is not capable of performing the task at expert level, humans tend to over-rely on GenAI and perform worse than if they had completed the task on their own.","tasks(9), workers(7), genai(7), data(7), bcg(6), experiment(5), study(5), knowledge(4), skills(4), task(4), consultants(4), scientists(4), leaders(3), humans(3), capabilities(3)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/gen-ai-increases-productivity-and-expands-capabilities
Attracting Chips Investment: Industry Recommendations for Policymakers,"August 08, 2024","Chips are integral to the 21st century economy, from connected vehicles and data centers to mobile devices,AI, and streaming platforms. Booming demand will drive a projected $2.3 trillion investment in wafer fabrication capacity alone in 2024–2032. Fab capacity growth is exerting a “pull effect” on the rest of thesemiconductorsupply chain in design; materials; equipment; assembly, test, and packaging (ATP); and other segments.

Historically, the semiconductor supply chain has been concentrated in a few regions: East Asia, Western Europe, and the United States. But the industry’s expansion across borders is increasing as semiconductor companies invest outside their HQ regions to build resilience while taking advantage of incentives and new market opportunities. This trend presents an exciting opportunity for countries and localities to deepen their footprint in the semiconductor supply chain.

For this new report,Attracting Chips Investment: Industry Recommendationsfor Policymakers, BCG and the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) interviewed SIA member companies, as well as industry and regional experts, to understand how semiconductor companies choose where and how to invest. We outline the following five primary factors that impact investment decisions, and provide actionable recommendations for governments seeking to grow their semiconductor industry:

Google’s Latest Decision Keeps Cookies Around—for Now,"August 01, 2024","Last week, Google announced that it was canceling its plan to eliminate third-party cookies in its Chrome web browser. Instead, it is working on a plan that would allow consumers to opt out of them more easily.

“Even though this decision means that third-party cookies remain, it’s another step on the long, steady march toward the death of third-party cookies,” says BCG Managing Director and Senior PartnerMark Abraham. “We’re not there yet, but we’re very much in the twilight of third-party cookies. The fact that consumers will be more easily able to opt out means that companies will simply have access to less of them over time.”

According to a BCG study, a majority of marketers estimate that the ongoing changes to third-party cookies are putting at least 20% of their data used for targeted marketing at risk. Google’s announcement addresses the concerns of marketers while also responding to the privacy concerns of consumers. The immediate challenge to marketers is mitigated, but they still must prepare for a cookieless future in the long term.

Brands that have adapted their marketing and no longer use third-party cookies have seen theirdigital marketingperformance improve by 10% for mature enterprises and up to 100% for small and medium-sized businesses, based on BCG experience.

Third-party cookies enable companies to track consumer activity across every internet site they visit, including their transactions and browsing history. Many companies use third-party cookies to understand consumer behavior, build personalized profiles, and tailor their marketing outreach.

Other web browsers, including Firefox and Safari, have already eliminated third-party cookies. Google, which still controls about 65% of global desktop browser volume, initially said in 2020 that it would follow suit. But it pushed back that plan several times and now has officially shelved it, meaning that third-party cookies will remain in Chrome for the foreseeable future.

Here’s how companies can revamp their marketing playbook to succeedwith—or without—cookies.

Maximize first-party data.Leading companies are investing to build digital relationships with their existing customers through their own apps and websites. They can identify customers through an email or login and track their transactions and browsing history directly—data that is the gold standard for understanding consumer behavior.

Look at zero-party and second-party data as well.Increasingly, companies supplement first-party data with what is known as zero-party data, which entails directly asking consumers about their preferences. For example, Stitchfix asks new customers about their style preferences, and media brands like Netflix and Spotify ask whether viewers liked or disliked a particular movie or song.

In addition, companies can use second-party customer data, which comes from partnerships that companies strike with brands that have a similar customer profile. For example, Starbucks customers can connect their Starbucks Rewards accounts with their Marriott Bonvoy and Delta SkyMiles accounts, enabling certain data sharing across these partners.

Win the battle of loyalty programs.Loyalty programs have exploded in the last several years, with new programs launching and existing programs seeing major redesigns to attract members, boost sales, and capture customer data. The challenge is that as programs proliferate, the universe is becoming fragmented, with consumers joining more programs without necessarily spending or engaging more. Companies need to make sure that their program is sufficiently compelling and offers real value to consumers in some way, rather than just rolling out a copycat offering.

Get better and faster at testing new campaigns.Experimentation is becoming critical in precision marketing, and companies need to build strong capabilities in rapid measurement and automation. Quite simply, the brands that test more campaigns and learn from them faster will win. Leading companies use agile teams, sprint-based pilots, and dynamic optimization to run hundreds of campaigns at once and get results back in real time—not just reporting on click-throughs but also on incremental sales.

Don’t alienate consumers by overwhelming them.Spam abounds, andgenerative AImakes marketing content even easier to generate, meaning the problem is likely to get worse. But just because companiescansend a marketing message to consumers doesn’t mean theyshould. A recent BCG analysis found that about two-thirds of consumers have received an inaccurate or inappropriate marketing message in the last 30 days.

"IT Spending Pulse: As GenAI Investment Grows, Other IT Projects Get Squeezed","July 16, 2024","Many companies want to pivot away from last year’s cost focus toward a more growth-oriented stance. But with GDP gains tepid and macro budgets mostly flat, the reality is organizations need to squeeze some mature areas of the budget to fund IT investments elsewhere. While cloud and security remain focus areas, not surprisinglygenerative AI(GenAI) is what’s taking center stage as companies pursue productivity gains. GenAI investment is expected to grow 30% in 2024, with industry leaders penciling in ROI three-times higher over the next three years compared with companies with little to no GenAI investment.

Those are some of the key takeaways from Boston Consulting Group’s latest IT Spending Pulse, conducted in collaboration with GLG, an insight network that provides access to expert perspective. (For last year's IT Spending Pulse, please refer tothis link.) The survey was conducted during Q1 of 2024 and captures insights from 330 IT buyers at the director and senior director level or higher. The respondents span industry verticals, with 66% coming from North America and 34% from Europe. (See the sidebar on separate Asia-Pacific data.) The IT Spending Pulse focuseson large (greater than $1 billion in revenue) and midsize companies, with approximately 60% of respondents leading IT spending at large enterprises and 40% holding roles at midsize companies.





Respondents give equal importance to cost control and enabling growth, with 54% indicating each is a top-three priority—a slight tilt toward growth since Q3 2023. Growth increased in importance by 5% while cost as a priority decreased 2%. Reflecting that dual focus, IT budgets are increasing at a modest but consistent rate. In 2023 they grew 3.2% compared with 2022. Going into 2024, budget growth has nudged up 3.3%. (See Exhibit 1).","companies(5), growth(4), cost(3), focus(3), spending(3), pulse(3), respondents(3), last(2), year(2), gains(2), budgets(2), areas(2), budget(2), genai(2), investment(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/it-spending-pulse-as-genai-investment-grows-other-it-projects-get-squeezed
Could GenAI Be Gaming’s Ultimate Power-Up?,"July 16, 2024","When people saygenerative AIis everywhere, they’re likely not including alien worlds, ancient dungeons, or pirate galleons. Yet GenAI—which creates original text, images, and other forms of content—has the potential to bring new efficiencies to game development and new experiences to players. With it, studios can forge more immersive worlds and get them to market at greater speed and lower cost.

So far, however, the industry’s embrace of GenAI has been uneven.

A Resurgent Sector Looks to Its AI-Powered Future,"June 20, 2024","TheAIrevolution is underway, transforming thetelecommunications, media, and technologysectors. Our2024 TMT Value Creators Reportclearly shows the results: companies that deploy, deliver, and create the infrastructure for this remarkable technology enjoy some of the strongest rises in revenues and valuations.

For this report, our core metric is total shareholder return, measured over five years to limit the impact of short-term market moves. All data is annualized, and median figures are used for sectors to reduce the influence of outliers. The data analyzes 343 public companies globally.

The mood is very different from our previous report, when the “tech winter” slashed returns, a downturn so severe that tech companies slipped from first place to third in our ranking of five-year TSR from 33 sectors. The impact on the media sector was still more severe; it slipped from mid-ranked 15th to almost the bottom of the rankings at 27th. Only the telco sector improved its five-year ranking, from 29th to 26th, as investors valued its utility-like characteristics.

Fast-forward to the end of 2023, however, and tech companies’ valuations had rebounded with such velocity that they were back at the top of the rankings—and with a lead over other industries unprecedented in the 26 years of BCG Value Creator reports. Media stocks, too, moved up significantly, to 13th from 27th place. For telcos, median shareholder return improved, but by much less than most other sectors; as a result, their ranking slid to 31st from 26th.","companies(4), media(3), sectors(3), tech(3), value(2), valuations(2), report(2), shareholder(2), return(2), years(2), median(2), severe(2), place(2), sector(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/resurgent-sector-looks-to-its-ai-powered-future

How Retail Media Can Top the CMO Agenda,"June 11, 2024","The globalmedialandscape has undergone a huge transformation over the past few years, driven by exciting new technologies and shifts in consumer behavior. Innovations such as digital streaming, social media, andgenerative AIhave received a great deal of attention from chief marketing officers, while retail media—another exciting emerging channel—has gone relatively unnoticed. Although retail media has been shaking up marketing practitioners’ day-to-day activities for some time, it has not enjoyed the same level of interest from the C-suite.

Retailmedia deserves better. With the proliferation of media channels, it has never been easier for companies to reach consumers. But with the fragmentation of audiences, it has never been more difficult to engage them. Retail media has the potential to revolutionize how brands speak—and engage—with consumers, making it a powerful strategic tool in marketers’ arsenal.

Consider one possible scenario. A beverage maker launches a new energy drink. The brand works with itsretail media network(RMN) partner —such as Walmart Connect or Target’s Roundel—to reach energy drink consumers on social media (using advanced analytics on previous purchases to select the target audience) and offer them a first-time purchase coupon in the retailer’s loyalty app. When a consumer next visits one of the retailer’s outlets, in-store digital screens encourage them to check the app to see if they have received a special offer. Once the consumer has redeemed the coupon to buy the drink, they are given a “streak” offer or a bulk-buy discount to build long-term loyalty—reinforced by advertisements both in-store and on their mobile devices.

This example shows how the tools of retail media can drive sales and build brand loyalty across multiple channels. Currently, however, retail media is far from this potential. Meanwhile, brands have nearly tapped out the shopper marketing and trade budgets largely funding retail media’s growth to date. And brands are reluctant to turn to other funding sources without a step change in retail media and its results.

To discover what’s needed to unlock additional brand dollars, we interviewed industry leaders from both brands and retail media networks and surveyed over 100 brand marketers and their agencies.

Our findings showed that, to secure brands’ continued support, RMNs will need to take retail media to the next level—Retail Media 3.0—by offering advertisers far more than they do today. Specifically, half of the brands we contacted are looking for retailers to offer data and insights in a way that they have never received from their traditional partners, the retailers’ merchandising departments. But media excellence—including programmatic ad buying and real-time reporting—will need to become table stakes as retail media competes squarely in the digital advertising market.

For years, major advertisers, particularly consumer packaged goods companies, have struggled with being disintermediated from a direct relationship with their consumers by retailers. This has created two groups: the “Data Haves” (retailers) and the “Data Have Nots” (brands). Historically, that disparity has been mediated by 3P cookies, which have enabled targeted advertising without 1P data. But with third-partycookie deprecation, this fragile equilibrium is already being disrupted. Retailers need to flip the script on data. Rather than hoarding it, retailers need to share data-driven insights with brands to allow the ecosystem overall to thrive and grow. Retail media is the vehicle for achieving that.

Retail media networks enable brands to buy advertising space across the retailer’s owned channels (such as its website, mobile app, or in-store screens) and paid media (with RMNs using first-party data to target relevant audiences across programmatic display ads, search, or social media). With either approach, RMNs use data and access to the consumer purchase journey to connect with consumers, measure the impact of the advertising that reaches them, and provide these measurements to the brands.

Retail media networks have gained favor among brands because they provide an effective route not only to target consumers but to engage with them at critical moments during theconsumer journey. Furthermore, RMNs’ closed-loop measurement capabilities enable companies to gauge how successful media campaigns are at generating sales, which as any CMO or CFO will tell you is the holy grail of marketingmarketing.

Within the next two to three years, the US retail media market is projected to be over $100 billion in revenues, more than three times the amount in 2021. Out of the additional market value that is expected to be created in this period, about two-thirds will be net new spending with retailers over and above historical trade dollars. About one-third will come from brands shiftingexisting budgets. However, getting to these projections will depend on retailers upping their game. If they want to capture the new money on the table and demonstrate real value creation and return on investment, Retail Media 3.0 will need to be an essential part of the strategy and have the buy-in of the CMO.","media(23), retail(14), brands(11), retailers(8), consumers(6), consumer(5), data(5), new(4), brand(4), target(4), years(3), digital(3), social(3), marketing(3), channels(3)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/driving-brand-success-with-retail-media-innovation

Closing Tech’s Gender Gap in Southeast Asia,"May 31, 2024","Technologyis transforming economies and societies throughout Southeast Asia, but the tech sector’s gender imbalance persists.

To understand this disparity—and identify potential solutions—BCG partnered with Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority to conduct a comprehensive survey of about 4,000 individuals across six Southeast Asian countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. We also interviewed more than 30 women in tech across the region. (This is a follow-up to a 2020 report we published on thegender disparity in tech in the region.)

Our analysis finds that the current state of gender diversity in technology across Southeast Asia is mixed:

Our research identifies underlying issues across four key moments of truth in a woman’s technology career, including in both technical roles—particularly those requiring deep expertise (such as software engineer)—and leadership positions.

Choosing to Study Technology.The decision to pursue a technology degree sets the stage for a future career in the tech industry. Our data reveals a wide variance across countries in the proportion of women enrolled in tech-related courses, from 36% in the Philippines to 58% in Malaysia. Our survey finds that early exposure to technology is important at this key moment: Gen-Z women who were exposed to technology before their university enrollment are 27% more likely to pursue a tech-related degree.

Embarking on a Technical Career.At this critical juncture, a noticeable gap exists: women constitute less than 30% of the applicants for entry- and executive-level technical positions across the six Southeast Asian countries. Furthermore, less than half of women graduates with tech-related degrees—a natural pool of talent for technical roles—choose to enter such roles. Our survey reveals that the prevailing perceptions of technical roles, such as being dominated by men and lacking work-life balance, are deterring women. Moreover, many women tend to lose interest in technology while pursuing a higher education.

Staying in a Technical Role.Nearly half of women respondents who are currently in a technical role are considering shifting to a nontechnical role. Across the six Southeast Asian countries, the primary factor for this change is salary, but many women also reported feeling stifled by the lack of a clear career path and a workplace culture that seems indifferent to the unique challenges they face. For instance, 32% of women in technical roles feel that their day-to-day work experience is not free of bias.

Advancingto Senior Leadership.The fourth and final moment of truth is advancing to a position of senior leadership. In these Southeast Asian countries, women account for only 23% of senior leaders in the top 50 tech companies, with just 8% in technical leadership roles. At this juncture, there’s a perception of subjective performance evaluations, with 30% of women in technical roles feeling that career-related decisions, such as promotions and stretch assignments, are not free of bias. However, having mentors and role models can help bridge this gap: women in technical roles are twice as likely to be promoted faster than their peers if they have a woman mentor.

Many entities—including industry associations and governments—already support women with some baseline initiatives, including recruiting, mentoring, networking, and outreach programs to boost retention. While those are valuable and should continue, we feel that the additional steps below should be priorities.","women(14), technical(11), southeast(6), technology(6), roles(6), tech(5), countries(5), asian(4), survey(3), career(3), leadership(3), many(3), role(3), senior(3), asia(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/closing-gender-gap-in-technology-in-southeast-asia
Why Video Streamers Need to Rebundle,"May 29, 2024","The advent of video streaming enabled consumers to break free from the longstanding pay TV model, when subscribers paid a flat fee for 150+ channels. Today, consumers can choose from among subscription video on demand (SVOD) services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Disney+, Max, Paramount+, Peacock, and dozens of smaller services. Recently, Disney, Fox, and Warner Brothers Discovery announced a new sports “skinny bundle.” And a bundle with Peacock, Netflix, and Apple TV+ for Comcast subscribers will add even more choice.

The problem for media companies is that the pay-as-you-go streaming model is far less profitable than the big-package model. A primary reason is high churn. The flat-fee TV bundle had high switching costs for consumers, both because unsubscribing meant losing access to essentially all TV content and they often needed to schedule a service call or return set-top boxes to a local retail store.

Streaming, by contrast, has much lower switching costs. Consumers finish their favorite series, click a few buttons to disconnect, and sign up again the next time there is a buzzy show. According tomedia industryanalysts Antenna, the average churn for “premium” streaming services was 5.5% as of January 2024. That implies an average customer life of just under 20 months. Coupled with high acquisition costs, this makes it extremely difficult for content providers to be profitable.

Instead, for sustainable growth and profitability, streaming companies need to be willing to reimagine their business models—again. In fact, they need to rebundle creatively. In practice this means focusing on two approaches: comprehensive streaming bundling, joining forces with other companies to offer multiple streams of content, and multi-product bundling, which provides a range of services—not just streaming TV—at attractive price points.

Media providers’ attempts to combat churn, such as by investing heavily in content and introducing discounts for yearly subscriptions, have not helped much. As an example, according to Antenna, Peacock’s monthly churn has fluctuated in a narrow band between 5.5% and 8.5% since January 2023, despite the service spending significant money on sports and original content. There is a risk that churn is becoming an ingrained consumer behavior as more people use it to manage their monthly entertainment budgets.

There are several reasons for this high churn rate. For one thing, increased competition has generated so much new and exclusive content that many viewers have become inured to it—if they can even find the content in the proliferation of SVOD options. Also, streaming services are not only competing with each other and linear TV but with other forms of media, such as podcasts, gaming, and short-form video, for the time and attention of consumers.

To overcome these challenges, media companies have experimented widely with bundles in recent years. Warner Brothers Discovery offers Max and Discovery+ together. Disney+ can be bundled with Hulu and ESPN+. Verizon customers can access discounted, ad-supported versions of Max and Netflix. Charter subscribers receive ad-supported Disney+ at no additional cost.

However, consumers have not adopted these mini-bundles in large enough numbers to substantially move the needle on churn. For example, when bundled, Hulu’s churn as of December 2023 was 3.7%. However, just 15% of Hulu’s total subscribers chose a bundled option, and as a result Hulu’s overall churn was 5.4%, almost identical to the churn of its unbundled subscribers. (See Exhibit 1.)

As currently conceived, today’s bundles aren’t working. A successful bundle will yield either better unit economics on existing subscribers (through lower churn or lower customer acquisition costs) or a pathway to acquiring new subscribers. Hitting this mark will require the industry to be bolder.","churn(9), subscribers(7), content(7), consumers(6), services(4), hulu(4), media(4), companies(4), high(4), video(3), model(3), peacock(3), new(3), costs(3), today(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/why-video-streamers-need-to-rebundle

The Art of Scaling GenAI in Software,"May 17, 2024","Generative AI(GenAI) is transforming software development. Not only is the technology changing the way code can be written, but it’s also reshaping every stage of the development life cycle—from requirement gathering, system design, and solution development to user experience design, testing, and deployment. When rolled out at scale, GenAI will shift the quality, velocity, and economics of innovation, which may result in a strategic inflection point in the industry.

However, many software companies are finding it difficult to produce results from GenAI tools. They’re struggling to get their development teams to adopt them; and even if they use them, they haven’t figured out how to capitalize on the productivity gains. Several deeply entrenched factors—such as developers’ comfort with existing tools and inexperience with GenAI, the difficulties of managing organizational change, and structural impediments such as legacy code bases and the steep learning curve—prevent these firms from fully capitalizing on GenAI’s benefits.

In this article, we answer the tough questions about GenAI in software development. We show that companies have to go beyond merely deploying GenAI-based coding assistants and transform their organizations if they want to unlock the full value the new technology affords. Specifically, a software firm must create an effective learning journey, manage change carefully, alter its ways of working, and rethink the product development life cycle to optimize GenAI’s benefits. Our learnings stem from the software industry, but our experience shows that they apply to companies in any sector and in any function.

GenAI is creating a lot of buzz, but its use isn’t as widespread as the hype would suggest. Three complications prevent companies from deploying it. (See Exhibit 1).","genai(6), development(6), software(5), companies(4), technology(2), code(2), life(2), design(2), experience(2), industry(2), tools(2), change(2), benefits(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/the-art-of-scaling-genai-in-software
Women Leaders in Tech Are Paving the Way in GenAI,"May 14, 2024","Generative AI(GenAI) is proliferating rapidly, and C-suite executives across industries expect that, on average, 46% of workers will need to be reskilled in the next three years as a result. In thetechnology industryspecifically, our new BCG survey shows that 55% of workers across various roles think that GenAI will be critical to their job success.

Women have historically been less likely to adopt new technologies than men have, especially in the early days. For instance, a 2020 YouGov report found that less than 40% of early tech adopters among consumers were women. If the adoption of GenAI follows a similar trend, there is a risk that the gender gap in the tech industry will widen further, asfewer than 30% of middle managers and senior leaders in tech today are women. Now more than ever, companies need to be hyperfocused on proactive measures that minimize and ultimately reduce this gap.

To determine if there are gender differences in adopting GenAI and if so, the root causes and the paths to a resolution, BCG conducted a global survey of more than 6,500 women and men employees in tech companies across seniority levels and functions. In addition, 15 women leaders in the tech industry provided their insights and views on a pathway forward. (See the sidebar “Our Methodology.”)

BCG’s global GenAI survey reached out to more than 6,500 women and men employees across four seniority levels and eight functions in the technology industry. The tech companies surveyed are located in five countries. (See the exhibit.)







In contrast to historical trends, women respondents to BCG’s tech industry survey are generally on a par with their men peers in terms of GenAI adoption. In fact, 68% of women in the industry said they use a GenAI tool at work more than once a week, compared with 66% of men.

Secrets to Scaling GenAI in Information Services,"May 13, 2024","For traditional information services providers,generative AI(GenAI) represents an unprecedented opportunity to drive sustainable advantage. By scaling solutions that leverage their vast data and content assets, companies can help their customers harness the power of GenAI while generating new revenue for themselves. Leading players across financial information, credit, publishing, and other info services are already beginning to see the benefit of GenAI at scale.

But for the vast majority of companies, realizing the full potential of GenAI has proved challenging. According to a recent BCG cross-industrysurvey, 66% of leaders are ambivalent or dissatisfied with their progress on AI and GenAI. This has also been the case with information service providers, many of whom have created proofs of concept only to find that developing a customer-facing product is more costly and resource-intensive than anticipated. Issues pertaining to accuracy of GenAI output, organizational capability and capacity, systems integration, and data preparation are among those standing in the way of successful scaling.

Providers that address these challenges and scale GenAI successfully will have access to a rapidly growing market. According to BCG analysis, the current market opportunity for GenAI financial services information products alone is around $5 billion to $6 billion and is projected to grow to $15 billion by 2026.

To date, GenAI has gained wide use as a way for companies to enhance internal productivity, and some are already using it to drive end-to-end transformation. But for companies that provide information products—such as financial, business, andsustainabilitydata—GenAI can be a tool to enhance the productivity of end-customers. This new revenue stream can help to justify early investments into the nascent technology.

While most traditional info service providers understand the value of this opportunity, few have managed to scale GenAI successfully. To learn why, in early 2024 we surveyed 100 professionals from providers who had experience scaling GenAI solutions. (See “About the Survey.”)

More than half of the survey respondents said that building GenAI products has been more time-intensive and costly than anticipated. Four challenges were cited most frequently: accuracy requirements, organizational capability or capacity, systems integration, and data preparation and management. (See Exhibit 1.)

In early 2024, BCG conducted a survey of 100 tech, data, and IT professionals from global information services providers across financial information; credit, risk, and compliance; business information; and other verticals. Of these respondents, 66 were considered experienced: they have started to or have successfully scaled a GenAI solution. The remaining 34 are considered inexperienced because they have conducted proofs of concept or pilots but have not yet attempted to scale a solution.","genai(12), information(8), providers(6), services(4), data(4), companies(4), financial(4), scale(4), opportunity(3), bcg(3), early(3), traditional(2), drive(2), solutions(2), vast(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/secrets-to-scaling-genai-in-information-services
Emerging Resilience in the Semiconductor Supply Chain,"May 08, 2024","Semiconductorspower today’s economy, from vehicles and mobile devices to data centers, medical equipment, clean technologies, and, of course, the upcoming AI revolution. In “Strengthening the Global Semiconductor Supply Chain in an Uncertain Era,” an April 2021 report by the Semiconductor Industry Association and BCG, we illustrated the value of the semiconductor supply chain for the global economy, while also identifying its vulnerabilities. A globally integrated supply chain has allowed semiconductor companies to realize efficiencies through scale and specialization, thereby creating roughly $1 trillion in efficiencies. However, geographic concentration in a small number of regions has also created challenges for supply chain resilience. Over the past few years, the COVID-19 pandemic, severe weather, natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, and other factors have elevated these concerns.

In our latest report, “Emerging Resilience in the Semiconductor Supply Chain,” we explore how the semiconductor industry is beginning to improve resilience through geographic diversification.

One major factor driving this resilience is a renaissance in industrial policy. Semiconductor-related policies, aimed at fostering innovation, economic and national security, and broader growth, have been announced and are being implemented by the US, EU, Mainland China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and India, among other countries.

Semiconductor companies, in turn, are responding. We project $2.3 trillion in new investment in wafer fabrication between 2024–2032, compared with $720 billion in the 10 years prior. Moreover, these investments are being made in ways markedly different from recent history. The US is projected to capture 28% of these capital expenditures, as opposed to the pre-CHIPS Act pace of investment, in which the US would have captured just 9% of global capital expenditures.

In consequence, we will see meaningful shifts in the global distribution of chip-making capacity, in particular for the most advanced logic chips—those newer than 10 nanometers—where we predict wafer fabrication capacity to diversify markedly beyond Taiwan and South Korea to include the US, Europe, and Japan, with the US increasing its share from nearly zero in 2022 to 28% in 2032.

Beyond wafer fabrication, we also foresee improvements in resiliency in other supply chain segments. Foremost, in assembly, test, and packaging (ATP), we expect the capacity footprint to diversify from Mainland China and Taiwan to Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe, supported by programs such as the International Technology Security and Innovation (ITSI) Fund under the US CHIPS Act as well as industrial policies in each locale. In similar fashion, although materials production will remain concentrated in East Asia, we expect it to follow future fab capacity to the United States and Europe to take advantage of cost and R&D benefits. Finally, in chip design, companies are expanding the geographic scope of where they hire, locate, and train talent for R&D and engineering.

While recent progress is encouraging, the semiconductor supply chain will continue to face challenges. First, industry cyclicality could break the resolve of policymakers or industry participants to stay the course. Second, supply-demand imbalances, particularly in more mature chip process nodes and technologies, could emerge, leading to the second-guessing of recent investments. Third, workforce challenges could act as headwinds to development outside of historical (and highly concentrated) centers. And fourth, restrictions on or reconfigurations of trade flows, if taken too far, could undermine the scale required for ongoing investment and growth.

As we look to the future, it will be imperative for policymakers and industry participants to stay the course, building on recent positive momentum to increase resilience, without overcorrecting and putting at risk the more than $1 trillion of value created by the global nature of the semiconductor supply chain.","semiconductor(9), supply(8), chain(8), global(5), industry(5), resilience(5), recent(4), capacity(4), course(3), companies(3), geographic(3), challenges(3), taiwan(3), investment(3), wafer(3)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/emerging-resilience-in-semiconductor-supply-chain
"For Insurers, Three Paths to Modernizing Core IT","May 03, 2024","Many traditional insurance companies have reached atechnologytipping point.

We estimate that a modern core platform with digital capabilities—such as greater process automation and the ability to manage real-time information across channels—can improve efficiencies and thecustomer experience, boost revenue by 25%, and accelerate new-product time to market by a factor of three to four.

Insurance transformationis not only an IT topic but a journey for both the business and IT. This requires companies to rethink their business proposition, distribution model, product offerings, processes, and, eventually, underlying IT platforms. In analyzing large international insurance groups (Tier 1 insurers) embarking on a core transformation, we have observed three main strategic approaches: centralized, federal, and a hybrid strategy that combines a federal plan with elements of a regional approach. We have also identified seven best practices to improve the outcome of any transformation strategy.

For years, traditional insurance companies underinvested in new technology and did their best to keep old systems up and running. In an industry with so few customer touch points, insurers had little incentive to digitize customer journeys. And given their strong market position, companies felt limited pressure to improve efficiencies. They were instead biased to preserve the status quo to avoid the operational risk associated with technology transformation.

But times are changing. Companies’ creaky legacy systems have become more prone to downtime—hurting productivity—and the internal expertise to maintain these systems is aging. Even regulations have become an issue. In Europe, for example, authorities are pushing insurers to build digital channels to enhance customer access and service; and, through laws such as the Digital Operational Resilience Act, regulators are requiring the industry to improve risk controls.

Moreover, modernizing the core has become a competitive imperative. Among traditional insurers, some first movers have already begun building digital channels and direct businesses. And pure digital players are launching innovative business and operating models incorporating the cloud andnewer technologies such as generative AI. Other traditional insurers need to move fast to harness the full potential of digital. In Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) and in North America (NAMR), for example, we expect that insurers will spend about $6.5 billion and 10.5 billion, respectively, on core IT modernization from 2024 to 2026.



While there is urgency to act, the obstacles that lie ahead are daunting. Even with a commitment from leadership and an adequate budget, re-platforming core systems is a difficult journey, and the learning curve can be costly. The potential for failure is all too real.

Some cautionary examples: a central European group gave up on a large cross-country platforming project after eight years, with a write-off of more than $500 million; a carrier in southern Europe completed its claims-platforming program but did so 500% over budget; and another central European insurer failed to internally develop a new software platform to support a direct business. At the root of these failures are some or all of the following challenges commonly encountered during a core modernization.

Too Big to Manage.Core insurance system (CIS) modernizations are large-scale programs, impacting multiple countries and stakeholders. Managing them as a project with a waterfall approach can create enormous complexity beset by a dizzying array of competing interests.

Misalignment Between IT and the Business.Shifting to digital platforms means moving to a digital standard (such as no-frills products or one-touch processes). Doing so while trying to maintain legacy business complexity quickly creates delays and costs—and can undermine the long-term stability of the solution.

A Lack of Common Interests.Given the extended replacement cycle, selecting a standard software for the core system implies choosing partners for the next 30 years. The mid- and long-term objectives of the insurer, software vendor, and system integrator must align tightly from the start, or the partnership won’t be sustainable.

A Shortage of Internal Capabilities.When an insurerselects a standard software platform, it should not completely outsource the core system modernization. Internal IT is crucial for prioritizing business needs. And giving so much responsibility to the vendor can easily lead to conflicts of interest, frequent misalignments, and rework.

Tech Stack Obsolescence.The pace oftechnology evolution is accelerating (for example, from monolith software to microservices and from microservices to serverless solutions), so insurers should avoid significantly customizing off-the-shelf platforms. While a heavily customized platform might work well at first, it can’t be automatically or regularly upgraded by the vendor, hastening its obsolescence.

Core platform transformations began with Tier 2 and Tier 3 insurers several years ago because these companies were the first to feel the pressure on costs and margins. Most of them adopted off-the-shelf solutions, with external application management and cloud-based infrastructure.

More recently, Tier 1s have started their CIS transformations. Given the thorny challenges described above and the history of failure, insurance companies must carefully choose their CIS transformation strategies. We have observed three main approaches in the Tier 1 group, depending on the specifics of the insurer’s business model.

Centralized.Companies pursuing this strategy use vertical, bespoke components to underpin the IT platform. They leverage internal resources and competencies to deploy the bespoke solutions over time and across multiple entities or countries. A centralized IT services provisioning unit (a shared service center, for example) often lends support.A centralized platform is subdivided into three distinct layers, each serving a specific purpose:

Federal.Insurers taking this approach leverage both off-the-shelf packages and bespoke solutions for the new core platform. At the group level, the standard software is chosen with an eye toward improving the cost base, but the implementation occurs at the individual-country level with the help of system integration partners. In addition, when necessary, local insurers build bespoke platforms to serve larger and more complex business units, to ensure a perfect fit with business products and maintain market differentiation.

Hybrid.This strategy combines the federal approach with a regional plan. Relatively autonomous large countries, with the help of system integrators, develop and operate their own IT platforms under the federal approach. Meanwhile, the global insurer uses a regional approach for similar small and midsize countries—making choices at the group level to standardize the business model so that the same core platform, processes, and products are used throughout the region.

The small countries can develop some bespoke elements—often leveraging modules within the market solution (product engines, for example) to accelerate development—but they must do so according to group-level guidelines. BCG recently worked with a large regional European insurer that used this hybrid strategy to deploy a CIS transformation across several countries in less than two years.

No matter which of the three strategies an insurer chooses to pursue, seven best practices will improve the odds of completing a successful transformation:







The large global insurance groups embarking on a core transformation need to choose their strategies and deploy their resources carefully—recognizing that core modernization is not only an IT topic but a journey for both the business and IT. And they need to move fast or risk falling dangerously behind the first movers and pure digital players. But with the right strategy and attention to the seven best practices, these companies can ensure their own success.

"Software Projects Don’t Have to Be Late, Costly, and Irrelevant","April 30, 2024","It’s become one of the more persistent and unshakeable complaints from businesses large and small: tech projects routinely suffer long development delays and expensive cost overruns, making them appear in too many cases to be more troublesome than they are worth.

Having heard these complaints too frequently to ignore, we set out to determine if the anecdotal claims are true—and, if they are, to identify why these problems keep arising and what the most effective solutions might be.

What we learned was surprising, both in terms of the breadth of project shortfalls and the way they must be addressed. We discovered that popular agile software development principles—involving, for instance, cross-disciplinary teaming and progress tracking—are pertinent but not sufficient to guarantee success. We also learned that improving the outcomes of IT projects at most companies will depend squarely on technology leadership creating the proper requirements and culture for teams to be able to deliver in agile fashion. Up to now, this has proved to be difficult to achieve.

To begin tackling this issue, BCG conducted a survey of global business and technical-side C-suite executives across 25 industries, includingtechnology, consumer goods, retail, health care, and manufacturing, among many others.

We deliberately focused our survey on internal software development projects, primarily custom programs and applications targeting a specific business priority, such as marketing automation and streamlining tools, forecasting suites, and pricing models. And we avoided large-scale enterprise resource planning implementations or cloud migrations and other big projects potentially impacted by the contributions of external contractors and system integrators; such projects are so wide ranging and complex that it would be difficult to determine the precise locus of their shortcomings.

The survey results were unambiguous: disappointment with IT is a real thing. Nearly half of all respondents said that more than 30% of the technology development projects in their organizations suffer from delays or budget overruns, while nearly one in five respondents indicated that less than satisfactory outcomes occur more than 50% of the time.

The Race for Advanced AI Chips,"April 17, 2024","Right now, demand for the advanced chips needed to power AI is skyrocketing. In response, many leading technology companies are unveiling new models of AI chips.

This month, Intel, Meta, and Google have all announced their latest AI chips.

And Nvidia showcased its new AI chip at its annual developer conference in March, promising super-fast processing speeds. The semiconductor company is a leading manufacturer of the graphic processing unit (GPU) chips needed for large language models, and this year has become the third largest public company in the world by market capitalization.

“Chips are the building block of a new type of economy. No matter what industry you are in—consumer goods, health care, shipping—the business processes are becoming AI-enabled, says BCG Managing Director and PartnerSuchi Srinivasan, an expert in AI in the enterprise.

“Everyone needs a supply of AI chips. And the opportunity to supply them is vastly larger than any one company can realistically fulfill. Sothere’s plenty of room for new players, and the ecosystem is evolving rapidly.”

Many large technology players and cloud providers have already locked in supply from chip providers. They are also ramping up house efforts to create their own chips so they have more control over the value chain and to introduce greater innovation.

The innovation cycle around AI chips is only just beginning, and GPUs are just the start, Srinivasan says. As AI workloads mature, we will see the emergence of more specialized and therefore efficient architectures to address new workloads.

And the pressure on cost will increase further as enterprises move from model development to widespread deployment, increasing the need for alternative supplies to help keep prices in check.



These are some of the factors to consider about future market dynamics for AI chips.

In the short term:

Many of the big technology players have already pre-bought a supply of AI chips for the next few years.And chips are becoming more efficient, meaning that fewer are needed.

But there is also likely to be a mismatch between supply and demand. Some software companies have pre-ordered hardware before they have fully developed the software applications to fully utilize it, while other software firms may find themselves unable to secure the supply of GPUs they need if their applications are scaling and require more chips than expected.

Pricing will be inflexible while the choice of suppliers is limited. In time, new pricing structures and licenses are likely to emerge, as buyers move away from legacy token-based systems that can be difficult to navigate.

In the longer term:

Many countries, including the US, the EU nations, and India, are investing heavily in new semiconductor facilities to build the wafers which form a base for the advanced chips.

However, they will take many years to come onstream.

And the rapidly changing market for AI presents both new opportunities and could create some bottlenecks:

“The market is hungry for viable and competitive options to supply AI chips, but it remains to be seen how fast alternative sources of supply will be able to offer the desired price, sophistication, and scale,” says Srinivasan.

“However, enterprises can’t afford to wait for greater certainty about the chips market before experimenting with AI. Companies need to jump in and start iterating now in order not to be left behind in the race to create value.”","chips(15), new(8), supply(6), many(5), market(5), technology(3), companies(3), company(3), players(3), software(3), demand(2), models(2), chip(2), semiconductor(2), large(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/the-race-for-advanced-ai-chips
The Big Sports Bundle and the Start of Streamlined Streaming,"April 09, 2024","Right now, some of the biggest media companies in the world are hammering out the details of a new joint venture to bundle their streaming services together to attract sports fans.

Walt Disney’s subsidiary ESPN, Fox, and Warner Bros. Discovery will launch a standalone app this fall that offers many of the highest-profile sporting events including football, baseball, basketball, tennis, golf, soccer, and motor racing.

“The move toward cross-company bundling reflects the maturing of the video streaming market. Providers are grappling with a complex and competitive environment when going direct to the consumer, challenging cost structures, and the need to drive down churn,” says BCG’sNeal Zuckerman, a managing director and senior partner at BCG who leads theGlobal Institute for the Future of Television(GIFT).

According to BCG’s most recent GIFT survey of some 2,000 consumers in the US who are active users of one or more streaming services:

Streamers hope that a pipeline of quality content and regular live events will encourage customers to stay for longer rather than binge watching and bolting. This allows for the higher pricing structures needed for a sustainably profitable business.

“I believe there’s a business imperative to try cross-company bundling.We know consumers feel overwhelmed by too much choice and want to access the video (and potentially other content formats) they want in fewer apps,” says Zuckerman.

“Many of the streamers have performance issues to address, including achieving sufficient profitability, low-enough churn, and ability to raise prices periodically. They can’t afford to maintain the status quo given the speed of the market, so competitively matched innovation is required. And I’m excited by the number of innovative offerings coming to market.”

Media firms have three operational levers to pull as they target healthy profit margins from streaming.

Grow and retain the subscriber base.New offerings that collect targeted content together in one place have the power to attract new subscribers. However, there’s also a danger of cannibalizing customer bases, including those subscribing to existing inter-company channels, linear television consumers, and even the customers of future product launches such as gaming services.

Target premium pricing.Offering differentiated and premium content may allow for higher pricing structures. And the evidence from BCG’s GIFT survey suggests that subscribers have some capacity to absorb price rises. Measures to tackle piracy and password sharing also boost income from subscriptions.

Lower costs.Joining forces to secure quality content may provide some economies of scale, especially where the rights to content are high. It may also be attractive for advertisers wanting to target certain demographics or interest groups.

“In addition, firms will need to maintain a relentless focus on engagement, the availability and quality of content, discoverability, and evolving customer trends,” says Zuckerman.

“But with our latest survey suggesting there is room for higher price structures, as well as more subscribers to capture, the growth opportunities are there for those who can create the right products.”","content(7), structures(4), bcg(4), services(3), zuckerman(3), gift(3), survey(3), consumers(3), quality(3), target(3), subscribers(3), media(2), new(2), many(2), events(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/is-this-the-start-of-streamlined-video-streaming
"Cloud Transformation, Without the Risk","April 08, 2024","The explosive growth in public cloud computing shows no signs of abating any time soon. Spending with the three largest cloud companies—Amazon, Microsoft, and Google—soared by $148 billion in the past five years, to $211 billion in 2023, a 337% jump. Almost 30% of IT leaders say their companies plan to increase spending on the cloud during the next 12 months,according to a recent BCG survey,and the rise ofgenerative AIwill only boost spending further, with a similar percentage saying they expect to spend more onAIand machine learning, including GenAI.

The logic behind the ongoing gold rush is clear:cloud computingcan be far more efficient and less costly than in-house IT. And it offers the potential for greater flexibility and speed in meeting the changing needs of companies operating in rapidly evolving business environments. Organizations that get the transformation right can lower infrastructure costs by up to 40%, boost productivity by as much as 50%, and accelerate time to market by up to 60%.

Despite the promise of cloud computing,accomplishing a smooth migration isn’t easy. Challenges and pitfalls include a poorly defined scope and design, an ineffective cloud economic model, the difficulty posed by complex legacy infrastructure, and a lack of competence in managing cloud-based technology.

Moreover, many organizations fail to realize that moving to the cloud requires afundamental shift in mindsetaway from a traditional data center model. As a result, many cloud transformation programs fall short of their revenue generation and cost-saving objectives, with materially harmful financial consequences.

Instead, companies must avoid the predictable traps and focus on five factors that can significantly improve their chances of success. Here, we offer a detailed framework for reducing the inherent risks, from the planning stage through to full operation in the cloud. The goal: to ensure that businesses capture the full benefits of cloud computing.

Our experience shows that companies making the transition to the cloud typically fall into one or more of five common traps:

Failure to address any of these challenges promptly can have severe consequences. Increased costs, project delays, and wasted resources can result in significant financial losses. Poor planning and a lack of coordination with business units can mean missed opportunities and dissatisfied customers, eroding companies’ competitive advantage. And failure to ensure a smooth transition could lead to heightened scrutiny from investors and regulators—and even reputational damage. Companies that delay resolution of these challenges can further compound the damage, making course correction even more difficult and costly.

Avoiding the potential pitfalls during a migration to the cloud is critical if companies are to realize the full benefits of cloud computing. While there is no single route to success, organizations can improve their likelihood of a winning transition—and minimize the inherent risks—by taking these crucial steps.

Treating the Transition as a Business Transformation.In practice, a major cloud migration is ultimately a critical lever for transforming the business itself, since operating in the cloud differs significantly from on-premise infrastructure. Yet companies often implement their cloud programs as part of an infrastructure strategy without taking into account the wider business context. Before launching the transition, organizations must establish a vision for the cloud that recognizes and incorporates the principles of speed to value and resilience—rapidly boosting business value by creating a more efficient platform for development teams and accelerating product delivery.

To support the vision, companies must develop a well-defined cloud strategy that clearly articulates the business objectives and clarifies the overall scope of the program. And they need to clearly communicate this across the entire organization. The strategy must be carried out through a well-governed program linked directly to the right tactical decisions—what, when, and how to migrate—to maximize business return on the cloud investment.

Cloud computing requires changes to the business operating model as well as the technology operating model. Successful organizations ensure that their cloud program aims to change the business rather than the other way around. A properly revised and updated business operating model should enable the company to reap the benefits of operational efficiency through greater automation of resource provisioning, monitoring, and management. And it should help the governance and compliance functions conform to internal policies and appropriate regulations while fostering a culture of business model innovation, resilience, and continuous improvement through the cloud’s inherent flexibility.

Adopting a Migration Factory Approach.All too often, companies attempt to reinvent the wheel for every workload type that needs migrating, wasting time and resources. Successful organizations use a factory approach for migrating workloads to the cloud. They have a clear definition and detailed cloud migration and architecture requirements for each workload type—everything from front-office business applications and analytics platforms to complex data integration platforms and legacy systems—and they develop a specific migration pattern for each type.

A factory approach will also allow teams to speed up future application migrations and transformations. The key is to make sure that the process is iterative and follows continuous improvement methodologies. Companies should conduct pilot migration tests to prove each pattern before scaling it for use in parallel across multiple teams. And they should apply lessons learned from ongoing migrations to improve each migration pattern.

Carefully Managing Cloud Consumption.Getting cloud consumption levels right is critical to a successful transition. Companies must be especially careful to manage over-consumption in the cloud. Cloud FinOps, the practice of actively measuring and managing consumption and spending in the cloud, must be embedded into the work practices of all stakeholders. Every team should know the cost implications of its cloud design and engineering decisions. Successful organizations support this by establishing a FinOps function that spans business, technology, and finance to ensure that their investment in the cloud aligns with overall strategic goals and delivers business value.

Under-consumption can sometimes be as big a problem as over-consumption. When companies initiate large cloud programs, they typically establish a commitment to a chosen cloud provider that sets out a target consumption level. If that level isn’t met, they may fail to earn significant discounts, credits, and support. To avoid this, organizations must get the sizing of the consumption target and timeline right in the first place, in light of the cloud transition’s business objectives—and then build an operating model that appropriately manages the target. By developing a reliable cloud infrastructure, dependent on and supported by an efficient developer environment, the technology function can hit its consumption targets and maximize the value gained from the cloud platform.

Maintaining Strict Vendor Managementand Developing Skills In-House.Although third-party involvement is inevitable in any cloud transformation, excessive reliance on outside partners will inhibit the development of the in-house skills needed for a successful cloud transformation and the implementation of the new operating model. To avoid this, companies must oversee their partners and vendors effectively, from the outset, instituting appropriate controls to manage expectations during the transition and once the system is up and running. Internal staff must make all key decisions, and partners should be required to work alongside in-house teams rather than in their own silos. This will prevent any potential risks from over-reliance on partners.

Contracts should be written to ensure that all third parties are held accountable for the successful outcome of the program, and these agreements should be agile in nature rather than written as long fixed-term contracts, which limit scope. Commercial incentives and the sharing of productivity gains among all parties will encourage continuous improvement. Finally, terms should include rigorous program governance mechanisms to track results and confirm that timeline commitments are being upheld.

To promote the development in-house of the skills needed to operate in the cloud, successful organizations focus on three key areas: they hire leaders with experience in successful cloud transformation, develop cloud training programs to cultivate in-house talent, and bring in trusted third-party cloud specialists to work alongside and improve the skills of internal staff.

Establishing a Proactive Program Assurance Capability.Large cloud transformation programs typically include risk and governance functions, but all too often, when needed, these programs intervene too ineffectively and too late. To minimize execution risk, companies should establish a proactive program assurance capability to maximize the value captured through the transition. Effective program assurance allows organizations to anticipate challenges, ensure alignment with goals, maintain quality, and efficiently manage resources.

As we have seen, all major cloud transition programs are risky and fraught with potential pitfalls. Under these conditions, companies have a considerably greater chance of achieving sustained value within budget if they make quality assurance an integral part of the process throughout. In our experience, committing an additional 3% of the overall budget to program assurance can save more than 30 times the cost of any de-risking effort required. (See “A Framework for De-Risking Cloud Transformations.”)

Companies should follow a consistent, comprehensive approach to assuring the quality of their cloud program throughout the transformation journey:

Early action on the part of company leaders is key to successfully de-risking the transition to the cloud and maximizing the business value to be gained, since these senior executives play a critical role in fostering the most conducive environment for a profitable cloud transformation. To ensure success, CIOs and CTOs as well as their CEOs should make sure to get complete answers to five questions from their cloud transformation team:





To create sustainable value in a cloud transformation, organizations must employ a competent and robust de-risking strategy that addresses the potential causes of failure. There are many different hurdles to be cleared before a satisfactory cloud transformation can be accomplished. But by understanding the common challenges, addressing them early, and following a comprehensive approach, leaders can steer their companies toward successful execution, maximizing the benefits of the cloud and underpinning long-term success.

Technology’s Central Role in Post-Merger Integration,"March 19, 2024","

This is a modal window.

Jonathan Milde



Inpost-merger integration, technology issues have become as critical as the traditionally emphasized financial and people considerations. Technology and data platforms are increasingly vital in facilitating the multiyear integration process, accelerating business synergies, and realizing the transaction’s broader ambitions.

Companies that fail to adequately addresstechnologyand data in PMI jeopardize near-term business continuity and impede efforts to achieve the merger’s longer-term objectives, such as promoting competitiveness through efficiency and innovation. They also risk diminishing value for consumers, value chain partners, and investors.

The solution is to move technology to the center of PMI. Although elevating technology's role may seem straightforward, it requires companies to adjust their PMI processes. This begins with establishing joint leadership of integration initiatives across business and technology functions and aligning their strategic priorities. To support integration efforts, companies must institute robust governance and the right operating model and foster a data-driven culture to guide decision making.

By taking these steps, companies have rapidly moved from table stakes, such as maintaining service levels, to value-creating activities, such as transforming products and applying their combined data to boost revenue.

The imperative to emphasize technology in PMI results from two main factors: its criticality throughout the integration process and its enablement of broader enterprise synergies.



Technology and data play essential roles throughout the three horizons of the integration process.

Denmark’s GenAI Paradox: From Lagging to Leading,"March 18, 2024","The most extensive Nordic survey to date has been performed to investigate the adoption and application of Generative AI (GenAI) by Danish companies, yielding a comprehensive analysis of how businesses are interacting with and harnessing the power of this innovative technology. Including responses from more than 572 Danish company executives and senior management across all industries and company sizes, the survey presents us with a representative picture of the full Danish industry.

Generative AI (GenAI) represents one of the most significant technological breakthroughs of the modern era. By harnessing the power of large language models and machine learning, GenAI has the potential to fundamentally reshape how businesses operate and deliver value. As an innovation leader, Denmark finds itself at a critical juncture—whether to fully embrace this wave of disruption or risk falling behind global competitors.

Regulating the Next Generation of Satellites,"March 14, 2024","The use of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites is reaching an inflection point, with the potential to transform communication. Compared to traditional satellites, LEO technology offers faster communication and lower latency. The satellites themselves are smaller and less expensive to build and launch—with costs projected to continue falling. Thousands of first-generation LEO satellites are already in orbit, but new versions are coming in greater numbers. They will not replace existing satellites but complement them, creating a hybrid solution that will unlock new uses based on seamless connectivity everywhere on Earth—even in the most remote locations.

Governments—to capitalize on this opportunity—will need to create the right regulatory framework, offering satellite operators a unified set of rules for everything from spectrum allocation to the removal of space debris. The future of satellite technology is promising, but that will only play out with the right level of coordinated support from government.





The global satellite communications market is on track to reach $40 billion to $45 billion by 2030, according to our analysis, up from roughly $25 billion right now. LEOs are expected to contribute roughly 40% of the market at that point, primarily because they offer features that existing satellites do not. Until recently, most satellites’ usefulness has been limited by geostationary orbit (GEO) high above the Earth, offering slow, low-bandwidth connectivity for a small number of applications.

LEO satellites overcome these limits. They orbit at altitudes of 500 to 2,000 kilometers, a shortened distance to Earth that enables higher-speed, lower latency communication. Two pioneering constellations—Starlink and Eutelsat-OneWeb—already have more than 4,500 satellites in orbit, offering speeds of 25 to 150 Mbps and latencies of 25 to 60 milliseconds on land. The satellites launched by these and other players are first-generation LEO satellites that enable such uses as precision farming, fleet management, public transport, and direct-to-cell (D2C) text messaging over mobile phones. (The SOS service on iPhones already uses LEO satellites.)

The range of applications from LEO satellites is going to dramatically expand over the next five to ten years. During that time, the industry will deploy more advanced constellations using even better technology. For example, second-generation LEO satellites will have larger antennas and inter-satellite links (which transfer data directly between satellites) to provide signals that are five times faster than the current satellites and with half the latency and fewer ground stations. These upgrades will spur the development of new consumer and business applications. New players including Amazon Kuiper and Telesat, along with established companies like Starlink and Eutelsat-OneWeb, plan to launch over 45,000 new LEO satellites in total. Google and AT&T jointly invested $155 million in AST SpaceMobile to fund a constellation specifically to compete with established players. Other companies are making similar investments in LEO technology.

Longer term, third-generation satellites already in development plan to carry video calls, video streaming, and other data-rich applications. This massive expansion will enable a broader range of applications—we estimate at least 35 applications across 15 primary sectors, ranging from satellite-enabled broadband in remote areas to automotive connectivity, disaster response, wearable health-care solutions, and AR/VR applications. Collectively, those applications will create up to $20 billion of market value by 2030.

How Telcos Can Find the Right Balance in the Cloud,"February 28, 2024","Pilots have a phrase to rank priorities in a crisis: “Aviate, navigate, communicate.” Iftelecom companieshad a phrase, to guide them through today’srapidly evolving landscape, it would be, “Innovate, innovate, innovate.” To get ahead, telcos must focus on what matters most: creating unique and differentiating products and experiences. But can they truly do this when they are dedicating significant resources—as much as 5% of revenues—to a technology space that potential partners have already mastered?

Today, many operators are steering scarce time, talent, and funding into creating a private telco cloud—and to be sure, a cloud suitable for telco workloads is essential. Future networks will be based on full virtualization. They will leverage commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, incorporate new features through unified API, and employ AI—includinggenerative AI—for automation, optimization, and orchestration. These functions are the cloud’s stock-in-trade. Little wonder, then, that new network technologies such as 5G standalone and emerging standards such as open radio access network are accelerating the move to cloud-based architecture.

Yet taking cloud development private—which might have been the right call a half-decade or so back—is no longer the optimal path for many telcos. In most cases, creating a private telco cloud has proven to be more expensive and difficult than companies expected. Operators often find themselves tackling more integrations and greater complexity than they bargained for, inviting a rethink of their approach. But while telcos see the shift to the cloud as important, they don’t tend to see it as urgent. So rethinks and changes stay on the backburner.

Meanwhile, hyperscalers—the large public cloud providers—have worked to reduce concerns about data privacy, regulatory compliance, and other risks. And critically, the public cloud can be less public than was formerly the case. Today, telcos can deploy hyperscaler infrastructure on their own premises.

Getting the telco cloud right is no longer a matter of public versus private. It’s a question of balance: making savvy choices on what to build and what to buy, and ensuring that compromises favor speed and agility in developing new products. Striking that balance begins with clearly identifying the company’s business objectives and understanding the true price and competitive benefits of developing a telco cloud. It also entails seeing cloud in a new light: not simply as a route to lower cost of ownership, but as a lever for maintaining a focus oninnovation—creating services and business models that create value.

Most telcos view hyperscalers as playing a supporting role rather than a starring one in their operations. To a large extent, public cloud use revolves around running IT workloads, including the business support system (BSS) and the operating support system (OSS). Network functions—a telco’s bread and butter, making up 70% to 80% of its total workload—account for a very small share of activity. (See Exhibit 1.)","cloud(10), telco(6), public(5), new(4), today(3), private(3), network(3), telcos(3), business(3), products(2), many(2), operators(2), large(2), balance(2), support(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/how-to-find-the-right-balance-in-the-telco-cloud
A New Formula for Success,"February 23, 2024","A quick look at the top-ranked companies in our 2024 Telecommunications Value Creators Report shows varied routes to success. Nevertheless, some strategies appear repeatedly. Top-ranked companies have typically defended their core business, invested wisely in network upgrades, tightly controlled costs, and begun harnessing the power of AI.

In the five years from 2019 to 2023, the telcos in our survey delivered a median annualized total shareholder return (TSR) of 6%, up from 3% for the five-year annualized TSR we reported 12 months ago.

But before they break out the champagne, telcos should consider some critical context. From 2019 to 2023, the S&P 1200 index of global stocks had an annualized TSR of 13%, meaning that thetelco industryperformed below the market average. In fact, for the most recent five-year period, telcos ranked 31st among the 33 sectors we track.

A closer examination of the data reveals the industry’s challenges, which include stagnant (and sometimes declining) revenue, and patchy returns from a very substantial investment in 5G.

Telcos’ utility-like characteristics translate into relatively stable returns. As a result, in years (such as 2023) when cross-market returns are strong, telco returns fall short of the average, but in challenging years (such as 2022) they outperform most other sectors.

Sustainability Data Is a Big Opportunity in Information Services,"February 14, 2024","Theenergy transitionwill require many trillions of dollars in investment, as companies build more efficient factories, reformulate products, and reengineer supply chains to reach net zero by 2050. The legal, banking, accounting, and engineering firms that will help bring these efforts to life will in turn rely on information services for sustainability-related data and content.

This vast ecosystem translates into an immense opportunity for information services providers. But many have struggled to find the right niche.

We’ve found from our work with clients that three practices are key to success: starting with preexisting customer personas, aligning on a specific type of value creation, and anticipating the impact of new regulations. By following these practices, information services providers can play a vital role in empowering their customers’ success—and create tremendous value in the process.

The past few years have witnessed an enormous wave of sustainability-related regulations as countries worldwide address the net zero challenge. Some regulations, such as theInternational Financial Reporting Standards, relate to disclosure requirements and affect industries across the board. Other regulations, such as the US and European bans on perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as the “forever chemicals,” impact only certain industries.

Concurrently, consumer interest in green products is growing, andinvestorsare increasingly putting their money into companies that clearly demonstrate their commitment to sustainability. In 2023, approximately$10 trillion in investmentswere managed according to some type of sustainability criteria. According to BCG analysis, sustainability investing has grown over 50% in the past five years. And our survey of asset managers found that 80% list sustainability and sustainability-related initiatives among their company’s top priorities.

Businesses are taking steps to address these pressures and boost their sustainability ratings. Functions from R&D to accounting to legal have assumed more sustainability-related responsibilities. But they have encountered all sorts of pain points in the process. For example, multiple functions, such as marketing, investor relations, and accounting, may use the same data to develop reports that reach very different conclusions, creating redundancy and inconsistency. To address such issues, many companies have set up a separate office headed by a chief sustainability officer. But supporting functions across an organization has proved to be an incredibly complex undertaking.

While in certain geographies there has been some negative dialogue around ESG in recent months, the tailwinds created by net zero regulations, global sustainability investments, and business transformations remain strong. Together, these developments have created demand for all different types of information services, from sustainability scoring to supply chain risk assessments to investor guidance, and a diverse set of players have seized the opportunity.

Five Recipes for Failure in a Telco Transformation,"February 09, 2024","Successful transformations aren’t quite like winning the lottery, but to telecom executives, they sure can seem close. Most projects disappoint, and many fail. By our estimates, more than70% of digital transformations fall short of their objectives. While there’s never a good time for a poor track record, for telcos, the timing couldn’t be worse. Competition from hyperscalers, theshift to running separate NetCo(network) and ServCo (services) businesses, the drive tocreate value through AIand automation—pressure to transform has never been greater.

Most telcos have centered their transformations around IT—and little wonder. Outdated, inflexible legacy systems cripple innovation and responsiveness. They hinder opportunities to serve customers better, expand beyond the core, and take on all comers. Less clear is why so many transformations themselves wind up hampering organizations, driving disappointment instead of growth.","transformations(4), many(2), telcos(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/five-recipes-for-failure-in-telco-transformation
What GenAI’s Top Performers Do Differently,"February 09, 2024","Roughly a year after its launch,generative AI(GenAI) is already helping some companies create value in startling new ways. GenAI is different from earlier tech advances—more accessible to frontline employees, with a wider range of applications. A select tier of companies is capitalizing on these differences and leading the way in scaling the technology across their entire organization. As a result, they are not just experimenting with GenAI but using it to unlock efficiency gains, improve the customer experience, and boost revenue. For an organization with $20 billion in revenue, we estimate that GenAI can lead to gains of $500 million to $1 billion in profit, with nearly a third of those gains coming in the first 18 months.

Yet most companies—roughly 90% in our analysis—are further behind in their use of GenAI. These organizations often don’t know how to get started, they don’t know which applications are most impactful for their sector, and they don’t know the specific steps to take to catch up. To that end, we recently surveyed more than 150 senior executives globally across 10 sectors to understand where organizations are succeeding with GenAI. We supplemented that with in-depth interviews and our experience with nearly 200 GenAI client projects across industries and geographies.

This comprehensive research enabled us to develop a set of prescriptive, data-driven steps for how lagging companies can accelerate their adoption of GenAI and start scaling projects across the enterprise. These are the early lessons from the leaders in GenAI—and a playbook for others to take action on immediately.

Our analysis shows that companies can be grouped into three categories, based on their level of GenAI adoption so far. (See Exhibit 1.)","genai(8), companies(4), gains(3), applications(2), organization(2), revenue(2), organizations(2), steps(2), projects(2), adoption(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/what-gen-ais-top-performers-do-differently
Social Learning Is a Human Superpower. AI Can Make It Better.,"February 07, 2024","Intelligence is often seen as humanity’s superpower, the trait that sets us apart from other life forms. This belief also pervades the world of business. Companies fiercely compete for intelligence: from recruiting the brightest minds to amassing vast amounts of information and developing sophisticated algorithms to process it. Embracingartificial intelligenceis seen as the natural next step.

However,the true superpower of humanslies in our sociality and aptitude for social learning. Human knowledge is not only individual but also embedded within a broader social context. Our ability to learn from and collaborate with others is what sets us apart as a species. It is also what sets great companies apart from the rest of the pack.

The pace of both knowledge generation and obsolescence is accelerating, necessitating a more rapid and effective learning and adaptation process. Competition no longer revolves solely around scale or operational efficiency but also aroundthe rate of learning. Unlike the slower, more costly method of learning through individual trial and error, social learning enables us to acquire knowledge through the experiences of others—by observing what has worked under which circumstances.

Companies are social organisms and are also embedded in a broader social context. Social learning, therefore, happens naturally as individual learnings are codified and disseminated both within and beyond the enterprise. Employees may learn from colleagues on their teams, from the codified knowledge of many such teams, or from collaborators and customers in business ecosystems.

However, few companies have a deliberate and explicit focus on social learning and understand what it takes to get it right. In an era in which AI has the potential to enhance social learning, this focus becomes even more critical. An enhancement of social learning through AI will not happen automatically, however—it requires a deliberate, strategic approach.

The concept of knowledge generation and processing in organizations was shaped by the work of organizational theorist Ikujiro Nonaka, who introduced the SECI (socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization) model in1994.11Ikujiro Nonaka,“A Dynamic Theory of Organizational Knowledge Creation,”Organization Science 5(1), 1994.Notes:1Ikujiro Nonaka,“A Dynamic Theory of Organizational Knowledge Creation,”Organization Science 5(1), 1994.Building on it, we describe the social learning process in organizations.

The Solution to Data Management’s GenAI Problem? More GenAI.,"February 06, 2024","Generative AIhas a lot of companies talking—and looking to their chief data officer to put words into action. With its transformative, content-creating algorithms, the technology falls right in a CDO’s wheelhouse: turning data into value. But it also puts existing models fordata governanceand management in the crosshairs.

That’s because GenAI learns how to create content by training on massive amounts of unstructured data: text, video, audio, even programming code. Few companies have experience classifying or assessing this kind of material. Moreover, data governance is rarely the poster child for efficiency and effectiveness. For many companies, it’s a pain point, the work too manual and tedious—a real headache, especially in industries that are highly regulated or incorporate vast amounts of personally identifiable information. Businesses either throw a lot of people at the effort or not enough.

GenAI, in short, makes a process that was already a challenge even more of one.

Tackling this dilemma should be—if it isn’t already—at the top of every CDO’s to-do list. Across industries, companies are leveraging GenAI toturbocharge customer serviceandpersonalization,automate traditionally manual processes, andcreate value in ever-increasing ways. But without adapting their data strategy, policies, and capabilities, businesses face a Hobson’s choice. They can get bogged down in more manual work to ensure that all the new training data passes muster on quality, integrity, security, and responsible use. Or they can move ahead without that governance and risk the consequences—a risk that can cause top management to pull the plug on GenAI and its potential value.

But here’s the twist—and the silver lining. The same technology that increases the burden on data governance can also alleviate it. In fact, GenAI can do more than deaden the pain of all that manual, tedious work. It can largely eliminate it. GenAI creates and interprets content. That means it can augment or automate many key data management tasks; for example, labeling data with privacy or intellectual property concerns so it’s not used inappropriately. In finally bringing efficiency to data management, GenAI demonstrates one more way in which it’s a breakthrough.

By embedding GenAI in their data governance and management processes, companies can reap the opportunities without the burden. And with algorithms doing the legwork, data professionals can devote more time to value-adding work—creating still more opportunities to grow the business.

Data governance—the rules around capturing, storing, and using data, as well as verifying its quality and integrity—builds trust in data. Data management implements those rules, ensuring that organizations know where data is and where it came from, provide access to the right people for the right uses, and are aware of any issues—such as privacy and regulatory concerns—that might impact how they utilize the data.

While companies take different approaches to data governance and management, one element has long remained constant: structured data. Stored in standardized form within databases, structured data is easily labeled and classified, so companies can readily understand its key characteristics—and how they can and can’t use it. Lineage, traceability of sources, assurances of quality, flags for personally identifiable information or other concerns: it’s all in the record.

Unstructured data—GenAI’s fuel—typically isn’t stored, neatly labeled and classified, within a database. It’s everything from email and Word documents to YouTube videos and dialogue from computer games. Companies may have the data, but they aren’t likely to have much, if any, insight regarding the who, how, do’s, and don’ts of usage.

GenAI models don’t usesomeunstructured data. They use an enormous amount of it. And the processes for labeling, classifying, and ensuring data quality are largely manual. Companies may not be starting from scratch: they’re likely to have applied data management practices to documents used internally, for instance. But they still face a gargantuan task understanding all this data and ensuring its quality and appropriate use in customer-centered processes and value streams.

They also face risks, particularly around data remediation. A company that applies manual processes to so much unstructured information can quickly fall behind in correcting data errors and inconsistencies. That’s concerning for any business, but it can be an especially big worry for large, regulated firms.

It doesn’t have to be this way. GenAI’s key traits—an affinity for unstructured data and an ability to create content—make it a natural tool for boosting the efficiency and effectiveness of data management. In our experience, there are six main GenAI use cases for data management:

These use cases can have a particularly big impact on data stewards and data custodians. Tasked with ensuring data quality and promoting trust in data, these teams devote much of their time to manual, repetitive activities. With GenAI augmenting their work, data stewards and custodians can focus their attention—and capacity—on more complex, strategic, and value-adding tasks.

We recommend that CDOs take a two-pronged approach. First, prepare the data foundation—the data architecture, data platform capabilities, and data life cycle management (covering everything from sourcing data to preparing algorithms for operational use)—for GenAI business use cases. Second, incorporate GenAI into the company’s data governance and management processes.

While the journey will vary from one business to another, there are three general roadmaps. The one to take depends on a company’s current level of digital maturity, that is, on whether it’s a digital passive (a company whose digital and data foundation is still at a low level of maturity), a digital literate (typically a business that’s in the midst of a digital transformation but has yet to build out its data foundation fully or launch use cases at enterprise-level scale), or a digital performer (a company with an enterprise-wide data and digital platform that is fueling use cases at scale).

Digital Passives.For these companies, the primary focus should be the data foundation, developing the core capabilities and strategies to effect a data-driven digital transformation. This begins with assessing existing data capabilities. How is data supporting business functions? Where else could data create value? Which fundamentals—such as identifying, labeling, and cleansing key data assets—require attention? This analysis enables companies to understand where they stand on leveraging data and where they want to be. It serves as a guiding light for crafting a holistic data strategy: defining the optimal data architecture, refining data governance and management capabilities, and prioritizing use cases.

The great advantage of this approach is that it lets companies focus on what matters most and steadily build their capabilities instead of trying to do everything in one fell swoop, which is often unsuccessful. But even as they develop this data foundation, companies should consider how they might use GenAI to improve internal work. Integrating GenAI into data governance and management makes those processes more efficient, but it also sets the stage for leveraging GenAI more broadly down the road and helps businesses identify the talent they’ll need to develop business use cases.

Digital Literates.Companies in this group have a data foundation robust enough to support their initial forays into AI and advanced analytics. Their task now is to extend their capabilities in support of GenAI use cases. To that end, CDOs should drive proof-of-concept (POC) initiatives to explore—and demonstrate—the value that GenAI can bring to data governance and management. By pursuing POCs, companies can test the technology and sound out use cases without disrupting existing processes and workflows.

We recommend starting with one to three POCs, based on an initial review of feasibility and the potential for value creation. For each initiative, CDOs should develop a blueprint covering technology and talent requirements, as well as risk and compliance implications. Lessons learned from the pilots can help companies refine the business case for each POC, optimize the order in which they scale initiatives (weeding out those POCs that didn’t pay off), better understand—and plan for—talent and capacity requirements, and steer around roadblocks and bottlenecks when scaling.

Digital Performers.With successful AI use cases under their belt, these companies are poised to integrate GenAI into their business. Like digital literates, they should consider how they might improve foundational data capabilities with GenAI, pursue POCs, and leverage insights from pilots to plan for and steer at-scale deployment. But their high level of digital maturity puts this group in a position to move faster and more ambitiously. The key is to create—and unleash—agile squads composed of data scientists, AI developers, and data governance experts.

Digital performers are likely to already excel at agile, so applying its structures and methodologies to GenAI should be relatively seamless. Working together, squad members can assess the feasibility of leveraging unstructured data (such as scanned images or email) to create business value. They can then implement—in an efficient and collaborative way—the GenAI use cases that make the cut.

No matter which path a company takes, a few best practices can accelerate the journey. First, be selective: prioritize efforts by value and impact. Pilots are a great way to demonstrate—or discard—a business case and get the order right. Next, imbue scaling with robust change management and risk management, with a particular focus on data privacy andresponsible AI. Organizations that do this ensure that users—and, in turn, the business—get the most out of GenAI-enabled solutions, without opening the door to new risks and concerns.

All companies, no matter their data maturity, should appoint an AI ethics officer, accountable for the company’s responsible and regulatory-compliant use of AI. This individual will also onboard and enable any additional ethical-AI experts the organization may require. It’s hard to overemphasize the importance of responsible AI. It not only reduces the potential for harm but also strengthens trust, improves the performance of AI systems, and boosts value creation.

GenAI is an emerging technology and its track record is a brief read. But there’s no time to wait and see how things evolve. GenAI has the potential to transform everything from R&D to customer support. To realize that promise, CDOs need to act now: anticipating—and moving to alleviate—the burden that GenAI puts on data governance and data management.

Fortunately, GenAI is its own best enabler. By using it to automate critical data processes, companies can create a foundation that fuels the technology—and the possibilities it brings. GenAI may create content, but with the right preparation, it can create competitive advantage, too.

How Brands Can Help Tackle Disinformation,"January 23, 2024","The spreading of false information is the greatest risk facing the world over the next two years, according to the World Economic Forum’sGlobal Risks Report 2024.

Disinformation has come to the fore because of the increased ability of AI to proliferate and disseminate it, together with the high number of elections taking place in 2024.

While this is first and foremost a threat to governments and the institutions that support civil society, there is also a significant risk that companies themselves could fall foul of disinformation attacks, saysPaul O’Rourke, BCG’s managing director and partner who leads theCybersecurity and Digital Risk Practice.





In addition to possible political unrest, the dangers to brands include:

“There is a perfect storm of ingredients that has exacerbated the speed and exchange of information, while also making it more difficult to discern what is legitimate,” explains O’Rourke.

“Companies risk losing the confidence of customers, business partners or investors if they fall victim to an attack. There are also serious financial consequences if they have relied on erroneous information to make significant decisions.”

How Ad Sales Teams Can Kick Off Their AI Transformation,"January 19, 2024","Chief marketing officers, ad agencies, and others on the buy side are embracing generative and other forms of AI. The sales teams of traditional media companies, however, have been slower to adopt these tools.

The sales teams of traditional media companies have an opportunity to implement AI tools to help generate ad revenue and improve the level of client support and campaign customization.

A recent survey of 200 chief marketing officersconducted by BCG revealed that:

Winning on the Margins,"January 18, 2024","In a world marked by change and uncertainty, telecom operators have been resilient. As new technologies and competitors emerge—particularly thebig-tech hyperscalers—telcos are adjusting, transforming, and seeing results: revenues are ticking higher. Yet margins haven’t kept pace. From software licensing to labor and energy, costs are up, eating into profits and putting a damper on growth.

To get margins heading north, telcos will need to continue making adjustments, but in a surgical way. They’ll need to focus on levers that cut costs and boost efficiency while keeping performance steady—and then some. It’s a crucial balancing act. But it doesn’t have to be an elusive one.

This year’s telco IT benchmark (TeBIT) study, jointly developed by ETIS—The Community for Telecom Professionals—and Boston Consulting Group, reveals that two of the most promising levers are in plain sight:sustainabilityand process efficiency. The survey, conducted in November 2023 and covering European operators’ IT spending and performance, finds that both are already high priorities. By reducing energy consumption, sustainability programs can reduce energy costs. By cutting process waste—creating faster, leaner, more automated journeys—efficiency projects can also cut costs. When done well, these initiatives help telcos optimize margins while delivering dividends for customers and society.

So how are telcos doing on these two fronts? TeBIT finds each initiative very much a work in progress. But the study also sheds light on where telcos are gaining ground fastest, where they should redouble their efforts, and how certain enablers—likegenerative AI—can accelerate the journey. (See “About the TeBIT Benchmark.”)





On the revenue side, ETIS members continue to show positive, if not electrifying, momentum. Overall, revenues rose 5.3% in 2022, up from a 2.6% increase in 2021. Digital and ICT services, price premiums, and expansion beyond the core—in areas like media, eHealth, and even financial services—all gave the top line a bump.

Yet telcos continue to struggle with EBITDA margins, an indication that they aren’t managing costs and efficiency as well as they’d like. Margins have fallen steadily over the past several years. While the shift hasn’t been dramatic, from a 3.8% increase in 2019 to a 1.5% drop in 2022, the decidedly downward trend is concerning. The more margins are squeezed, the harder it becomes for telcos to fund the transformations and expansions that are integral for thriving in increasingly competitive markets.","margins(6), costs(5), telcos(5), energy(3), tebit(3), operators(2), revenues(2), levers(2), performance(2), study(2), process(2), finds(2), increase(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/winning-on-margins-tebit-executive-report
Big Reg Comes for Big Tech. Here’s How to Respond.,"January 17, 2024","As tech firms face a wave of regulation, and the potential for more lawsuits and larger fines, the old strategy of “move fast and break things” is unsustainable.

Regulators are targeting tech companies with more regulation and stringent enforcement across jurisdictions from California to the EU to India.

With more topics being regulated in more ways, tech companies must rethink their compliance strategy to deal with regulation at scale. Their previous approach of focused, dedicated action for specific regulatory issues will no longer work.

To ensure that innovation continues, tech firms must make thisnew approacha part of their innovation cycle, rather than bolting it to existing processes.

This task is given increasing urgency by the rapidly developing regulation of AI.

Regulators are broadening their focus.They are moving beyond privacy and competition to areas such as content moderation (for example, the UK’s Online Safety Act, passed in October), protection of minors (Utah legislation passed in March aims to protect under-16s on social media), and tech companies’ payment activities (the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau wants to regulate tech firms’ payments businesses and digital wallets).

Regulatory bodies now insist on transparency and accountability.The EU’s Digital Markets Act mandates stringent audits, enhanced transparency reports, and the appointment of a compliance officer by the company’s board—an indication of the heightened accountability expected in the tech industry. All of tech could soon be regulated like the medtech and fintech subsectors, with scheduled reporting and regulatory examination.

The advent of AI is bringing a new wave of regulation.President Biden’s executive order on AI safety and security in November and the EU’s proposed AI Act signal the onset ofa wave of global regulation. Many other jurisdictions around the world are gearing up to introduce similar legislation.

Enforcement and intervention have intensified.The ten largest fines under Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, totaling approximately €3.8 billion ($4.1 billion), were all levied on tech companies, and cumulative fines under that regulation now exceed €4.4 billion. (See the exhibit.)Enforcement on competition issuesin particular is ramping up.

Will Multimodal GenAI Be a Gamechanger for Industry?,"December 19, 2023","Google’s launch of Gemini can be seen as the latest advancement ingenerative AI, highlighting a shift toward multimodality.

At launch, ChatGPT (GPT3.5) revolutionized content production, and subsequent large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT4 and Gemini have the potential to revolutionize sectors such as manufacturing, e-commerce, and agriculture.

These new LMMs are trained on images and code, rather than on text alone. Gemini adds audio and video, allowing the AI to directly perceive the physical world.

The race is on among tech companies and open source communities to add new modalities that enhance LMMs’ industrial applications.



Such multimodal capability will be transformational for industry, saysLeonid Zhukov, director of the BCG Global AI Institute.

TraditionalAIis constrained by preset rules—users decide what they want the AI to do and train it for that task. While GenAI models break free from this constraint, LMMs go even further. They can take in so many forms of data that they could respond to seemingly unlimited situations in the physical world, including those that users can’t predict, Zhukov explains.

Companies’ current 10-20% efficiency gains from GenAI bots could expand into new domains with LMMs, he says.

And this is just the beginning. “Today’s LMMs can see and hear the world. Tomorrow they could also be trained on digital signals from equipment, IoT sensors, or customer transaction data—to create a complete picture of your enterprise’s health on its own, without explicit instruction,” Zhukov says.

Here are just a few potential industrial applications:

Firms need to prepare to integrate multimodal models. According to Zhukov, leaders should:

Telcos Show Modest Gains in Curbing Emissions and Helping Customers Curb Theirs,"December 18, 2023","Thetelecommunicationsindustry has a dual role to play in the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: to lower its own emissions and to support its customers in reducing theirs. This year’s BCG Telco Sustainability Index offers a comprehensive portrait of the progress the industry is making on both fronts.

Compared with the data for 2021, the new data—collected from published reports on a wide range of environmental metrics covering operations in 2022 from 29 major telecom operators around the world—demonstrates that, overall, the industry has made progress in three of the four dimensions we track. Telcos’ commitment to sustainability and to the circular economy and waste management have shown some improvement, though individual companies have achieved mixed progress. The customer enablement dimension still lags the other three, but progress there has been impressive, which bodes well for operators’ revenues and for other companies’ efforts to decarbonize.

In the fourth dimension, which focuses on reducing CO2emissions and energy intensity, results are somewhat poorer than last year’s, for two main reasons. First, most operators have already begun theirdecarbonizationand energy efficiency journeys and gained quick wins in areas such as switching to 100%renewable energy, where available. These initiatives have led to significant reductions in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, but they have also fed a countervailing effect. The considerable increase in demand for telecom services and data traffic across their networks is complicating operators’ efforts to reduce their carbon emissions and energy usage further.

A deeper look at the results reveals where telcos are making gains, where they need to improve, and what challenges and opportunities they face in doing so.

Data traffic over the world’s telecom networks is increasing rapidly, as is pressure from both business and retail customers for progress on key sustainability metrics. As a result, telecom operators are actively seeking ways to meet their sustainability goals, to future-proof their business against the rising costs of energy and of carbon abatement, and to reduce the risks associated withclimate change.

Progress, however, has been mixed. The telecom industry’s overall median score improved by 9 points in 2022 over the previous year. (See Exhibit 1.) But scores on three of the four main dimensions of the index did not show equivalent gains. (See “How We Create the Index.”) Median scores for commitments to sustainability and for circularity and waste management improved by 5 points, while efforts to reduce emissions and emissions intensity actually worsened by 3 points. In fact, the advance in overall score is largely due to a very substantial 24-point gain in customer enablement—and despite this achievement, the industry as a whole still needs to improve in this dimension.","emissions(6), sustainability(5), progress(5), telecom(5), operators(5), energy(5), industry(4), year(3), data(3), overall(3), dimension(3), efforts(3), points(3), customers(2), index(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/telcos-modest-emission-reduction-progress
Empowering the Marketing Function in B2B Sales,"December 15, 2023","A growing number of B2B companies are exploring ways to use marketing technology (martech) to bolster their go-to-market activities.

Cloud Cover: Cloud Prices Rise as the Era of Generative AI Dawns,"November 29, 2023","For the first time since the debut of cloud services, prices began to edge up in the first six months of 2023, according to theNimbus Pricing Index(NPI). Many have wondered if inflationary pressures and weaker revenue growth for cloud service providers (CSPs) would eventually lead to price increases. That time seems to have arrived. Although the impact is still marginal in most geographies, the price increases are significant in some European countries.



The NPI, which reflects average pricing in US dollars across the three main CSPs, recorded an average increase of 0.3% per price point (in other words, the price offered by one vendor in one location). The largest single increase was about 2% in South America. (See Appendix 1 for the full NPI table.) We also note that price ranges in some locales nudged upward in the first half of 2023 compared to the second half of 2022.

The four locations in Exhibit 1 are hubs where all three major CSPs have an offering that meets the specifications of the NPI. These modest increases indicate that CSPs continue to look for ways to boost revenue without resorting to direct price-list increases—especially in computing power, which is the largest component of most clients’ cloud billing.","price(5), increases(3), csps(3), time(2), cloud(2), pricing(2), revenue(2), average(2), increase(2), half(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/cloud-prices-surge-with-rise-of-genai
Marketing Science Is the Path to Profitability for Subscription Media,"November 27, 2023","The era of “growth at all costs” is over for subscription media companies. Customer growth has slowed, acquisition costs have risen, and churn is way up. These changes impact direct-to-consumer businesses across video streaming, audio, gaming, and publishing. Traditional media companies still transitioning to these models have been especially challenged, since they’re confronting these issues while also trying to keep up with digital native companies that pioneered many of today’s subscription marketing approaches.

Shifting priorities on Wall Street have only added to the pressure. Impatient with heavy losses in new digital subscription business models, investors are increasingly rewarding profits, not just unit growth. Valuations for many media subscription businesses are down substantially, with seven of the top ten streaming media companies in the US underperforming the S&P 500 index by 41% from September 2021 to September 2023.

Media and entertainment leaders know it’s time to pivot. Instead of organizing around revenue growth at all costs, they need to optimize for profitable growth.

Some high-performing businesses have already begun this transition, and they are incorporating precision analytics andartificial intelligence(AI) into theirmarketingcapabilities to improve unit economics. BCG found that these businesses are more successful at identifying—and retaining—high-value customers, with churn rates that are 30% lower than the average. They also excel at marketing efficiency, with nearly 50% breaking even on customer acquisition costs (CAC) within a year, versus the more typical three-to-five-year payback period.

What these companies are doing well, others can emulate, and they don’t need to bite off sweeping changes to do so. Our research and client experience show that targeted shifts can yield significant results, and gains can compound over time as companies expand their capabilities.



Since 2016, the number of video-on-demand services with more than 1 million subscribers globally has quadrupled, from 28 in 2016 to 120 in 2022. During most of that time, subscriber growth also soared. But that’s changed: the top ten biggest streaming platforms saw average acquisition plummet from 51% year-over-year growth in 2020 down to single digits in 2023.

To attract and retain customers in this saturated market, some media companies have leaned hard into content, significantly ratcheting up spending on production and licensing. In 2022 alone, spending on original content jumped by 45%. But this surge has driven down margins and further pressured unit economics. In response, some companies have recently begun to rein in content spending, but there can be peril in that path, too, since cutting quality programming will give customers less reason to stick around and may increase churn.","companies(8), growth(7), media(6), subscription(4), businesses(4), acquisition(3), costs(3), unit(3), time(3), customers(3), content(3), customer(2), changes(2), models(2), digital(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/why-subscription-based-companies-need-margin-based-marketing-approaches
A Net Zero Plan for the Semiconductor Industry,"November 07, 2023","Two trends broadly affecting thesemiconductor industrythreaten to significantly increase its carbon emissions from around 0.3% of total global emissions today.

First, demand for chips is accelerating. Virtually every modern industrial and consumer device—from children’s toys to rocket ships, and from the smallest appliance to the biggest automobiles—as well as most daily activities, such as sending an email, ultimately run on semiconductors.

Second, as chips increase in processing power, semiconductor production almost inevitably becomes more carbon intensive. Manufacturing more advanced semiconductors requires ever more complex processes, which consume more electricity and process gases.

If the current growth path were to continue unchecked, carbon emissions from semiconductor production would rise by about 8% annually in coming years and not peak until about 2045.



The need to combat climate change grows more urgent as the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting the increase in global average temperatures to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels slips away. To do its part, the semiconductor industry must develop a decarbonization plan to reach net zero.

But without a clear picture of semiconductor emissions levels at every stage of chip manufacture and usage, there can be no path to net zero. With that in mind, BCG, SEMI, and the Semiconductor Climate Consortium (SCC) have publishedTransparency, Ambition, and Collaboration: Advancing the Climate Agenda of the Semiconductor Value Chain, a report that offers the most complete analysis of semiconductor-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to date, as well as a detailed analysis of current and future emissions across the semiconductor value chain to facilitate targeted development of abatement solutions.

The research is especially notable for its ambitious range. Not only did we calculate Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions—essentially, emissions that directly result from semiconductor design and manufacturing activities and from the energy consumed during those operations, respectively—but we also examined Scope 3 emissions. These are upstream CO2 emissions from suppliers’ production and materials sourcing activities as well as downstream emissions from the use of chips by customers in daily applications.



Our research yielded five key findings:



The full report develops and analyzes a series of scenarios for GHG emissions in manufacturing through 2050, charting possible semiconductor industry outcomes against an overall goal of adhering to the 1.5°C pathway.

ASPIRE to AI Leadership: A National Strategy Blueprint,"October 30, 2023","Every nation today needs to devise a robust artificial intelligence (AI) strategy. It is not about competing with AI giants like the US and China head-on, but about finding a specific and competitive foothold in this fast-evolving digital landscape where data is the new oil. AI, like Prometheus's gift of fire, is acting as the spine for a broad spectrum of ground-breaking technologies - from data analytics to robotics and the Internet of Things (IoT). Its influence is sweeping across vital sectors such as healthcare, education, energy, manufacturing, and transportation. We are just at the rupture of the AI revolution, with its full impact yet to materialize. It's like watching a thrilling mystery unfold - exciting, unpredictable, and full of opportunities. The recent global frenzy over generative AI models – the new rockstars in the tech world - underscores AI’s disruptive prowess and its potential to rewrite the art of the possible. Nations now stand at a strategic crossroads; a window of opportunity is open for them to make judicious choices about their positions in the AI race.

It's a high-stakes game, and the prizes for playing it well are monumental: enhanced GDP, increased productivity, job creation, improved quality of life, and citizen welfare. This endeavor is akin to a carefully orchestrated symphony - with each instrument, each note, representing key enablers and value creators of national AI strategies. A well-coordinated, strategic sequence could lead to exceptional results; a misaligned action, however, could undermine the overall strategic trajectory. Therefore, the call for action is urgent and should echo in every corner of national policy-making chambers.

Currently, the private sector has led the way in AI. The AI Index compiled by Stanford University reports that, in 2022, industry players released 32 of the 38 machine learning models that can be considered significant, while only 3 were released by academia11Stanford University HAI ""AI Index Report 2023""Notes:1Stanford University HAI ""AI Index Report 2023""(significant machine learning models refer to AI systems that showcase a state-of-the-art improvement, are historically significant, or highly cited: in 2022, 23 of them were AI language systems). Along with its myriad benefits, AI poses significant risks. Certain types of jobs are likely to disappear. Ethical concerns around privacy and surveillance, algorithms reinforcing bias and discrimination, the protection of intellectual property, and the role of human judgment are severe and have far-reaching societal implications. Governments can and should play a constructive role in shaping industry developments, educating the general public, and promotingresponsible AI. But the clock is ticking – they must get involved before exponentially growing complexity and mass adoption make intervention and oversight even more challenging.

If the private sector has been the primary beneficiary of developments so far, a national AI strategy will pay dividends to the general public beyond protecting them from the risks highlighted above. On a practical level, governments can leverage AI to target resources and improve service delivery. If governments fall too far behind the private sector, citizens will grow more frustrated with the delivery of public services, and private actors will be exclusively setting the standards.While trends of the latter are starting to emerge globally, this imbalance risks prioritizing private interests without careful attention to the public good. More broadly, governments should drive the development of AI standards, norms, and priorities – nationally and globally – not relegate those decisions to the private sector. Importantly, they should do so proactively to keep pace with private sector-driven AI innovation.

Countries approach AI from different starting points. They have different priorities for economic growth, social progress, educational achievement, and so on. They bring unique technological, engineering, and other strengths as well as limitations and weaknesses. They also take different approaches to balancing the interests of the government, private sector, and individual citizens. Understanding its starting point and approach to these trade-offs forms the basis for shaping a country’s strategy. In supporting national governments in their AI strategies, BCG has developed the “ASPIRE” framework which further defines and codifies six foundational elements: (1)Ambition, (2)Skills, (3)Policy & Regulation, (4)Investment, (5)Research & Innovation, and (6)Ecosystem.","private(8), sector(5), governments(5), national(4), significant(4), public(4), strategy(3), models(3), strategic(3), index(3), university(3), risks(3), different(3), new(2), full(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/framing-a-national-ai-strategy-with-aspire
Let the Game Begin: How Esports Is Shaping the Future of Live Entertainment,"September 28, 2023","Our last two reports highlighted the rapidlyexpanding prevalence of gaming in people’s lives(especially in the Middle East), and theunprecedented opportunities this opens for the industry overall. Professional competitions are a natural extension of every game. Video games are no exception, with the first esports tournaments dating back to the early 1990s. From there, it was only a matter of time for them to move from arcades to arenas, and the stakes to grow from bragging rights to millions in prize money. This report explains what esports is, where it differs from traditional sports, and how to best leverage its potential both globally and in the Middle East.

This report addresses key questions, painting the picture of a vibrant new sector bursting with opportunity:







Turki Alfawzan

Chief Executive Officer at Saudi Esports Federation







Esports gets inspiration from traditional sports in many respects, but differs in 3 important ways:



Firstly, competition is built around video rather than physical games. While this may sound easy or even trivial, the intensity of an esports tournament can match that of a football final. Esports athletes experience significant stress and surge in their heart rate,11Source:National Library of MedicineNotes:1Source:National Library of Medicinewhile demonstrating extraordinary skills (unique in each genre), such as speed in their reactions (<200ms) or actions per minute (400-600 APM).

Even today, the likelihood of success in competitive esports is scarce for casual gamers. As with traditional sports, participating at a professional level demands full commitment and dedication from players, who spend 70-80 hours per week training to be the best in their game. Teams/players often live together to optimize their training schedule, sharpen team strategy, tactics, and communications, and develop their individual skills by playing daily against other great players. Complex systems emerge around players to ensure they are ready for important matches. Training schedules include developing new tactics, perfecting current ones, and sparring with other teams and players to evaluate skills and identify gaps. Although they play video games, esports athletes find that physical and mental health are critical for success, so many teams embed nutrition, physical training, and psychological support in their daily routines.","esports(5), players(4), video(3), games(3), traditional(3), sports(3), physical(3), skills(3), training(3), middle(2), professional(2), game(2), report(2), differs(2), new(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-esports-will-become-future-of-entertainment
Navigating the Costly Economics of Chip Making,"September 28, 2023","In 2020,we exploredthe economics of various types ofsemiconductorfabs. Our goal then was to examine the categories of capital and costs involved in building and operating typical advanced logic, advanced memory, and advanced analog chip fabs. We also investigated the role that government incentives play in the total cost of ownership (TCO)—and thus, fab competitiveness—across various regions of the world.

Since that analysis, fab economics have materially shifted. For one thing, a leading-edge advanced logic fab of the future will be at least two to three node generations beyond the ones we assessed in our earlier report. And technology advances are not all that has changed since then. There are also new supply chain and geopolitical challenges and shifting government policies and incentives. All of this has made it clear that fab economics merits a new evaluation.

This article focuses on advanced logic fabs primarily because we believe they will continue to garner the biggest investments in the coming years as the need to power all flavors of next-generation devices and equipment becomes more acute. Our analysis has led us to two fundamental conclusions. First, the cost of building and operating these fabs has risen significantly. Second, while the government incentives landscape is still evolving across multiple parts of the world, new, more aggressive financial support programs will be critical to make the economics of these massive capital-intense projects viable.

This research does not aim to provide a definitive number for how much these fabs should cost, nor what the incentives should be. As we will discuss in more detail, several factors that are unique to a company’s process technology, location options, design, and specification choices, among other things, can significantly sway the total cost. Consequently, this article aims to provide a framework of the considerations that should be accounted for to understand and quantify the economics of these mega projects.

To analyze fab economics today, we explored an advanced-logic, front-end manufacturing facility—a greenfield next-gen fab that would manufacture 2nm to sub-2nm nodes at 300-millimeter wafer size. Initial production would be scheduled for 2026. By then, we expect most companies will have undergone two major process technology advancements: First, a shift in the way individual features and transistors are fabricated on a chip; improvements are already underway that will amplify efficiency and speed, from Fin Field Effect Transistors (FinFET) to the Gate-All-Around (GAA) device structure. Second, the introduction of high numerical aperture (high-NA) extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), critical for continuing to reduce the feature dimensions of the processnode.11High-NA EUVL will surpass its predecessor’s (0.33 NA EUVL) resolution of 13nm by featuring a 0.55 NA lens that is capable of achieving 8nm resolution.Notes:1High-NA EUVL will surpass its predecessor’s (0.33 NA EUVL) resolution of 13nm by featuring a 0.55 NA lens that is capable of achieving 8nm resolution.

From a cost perspective, breaking ground on a new fab would be more expensive in the future than it was a few years ago in both upfront and ongoing expenditures.

"Service Up, Costs Down? Telcos Can Have It Both Ways.","September 26, 2023","For B2B telecom operators, customer satisfaction remains a work in progress. Unfortunately, the work is outpacing the progress. Telcos consistently score below other sectors on this key metric, earning them a standing—and a reputation—they’ve struggled to shake. Indeed, many providers have failed to raise a bar that’s so low, it could challenge the most dexterous limbo contestant.

Meanwhile, pressure mounts. Lean fiber players, system integrators, andhyperscalers—unencumbered by legacy processes or systems—can offer similar products but radically different experiences. And it’s not just new competitors tugging at the sleeves.Telecommunicationscompanies are also under the gun to deliver significant cost savings.

These twin mandates—raise satisfaction, lower costs—haven’t played well together. In many cases, process redesigns trigger savings only to trigger customer frustration as well.

But what if telcos could avoid the tradeoff? And while they’re at it, improve the employee engagement that can flag when helping customers takes too long, involves too many hoops, and brings too little joy?

Making this work is possible and so, too, are tangible—and sizable—rewards. Telcos can reduce the costs of a process, such as provisioning, by 80% or more while moving the needle on satisfaction. (See Exhibit 1.) And they can start seeing results soon: in our experience, within three to six months.","satisfaction(3), work(3), many(3), customer(2), progress(2), telcos(2), savings(2), process(2), trigger(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/reducing-telcos-costs-while-improving-customer-service
How Women in Tech Can Move Past the Middle,"August 14, 2023","As tech companies continue the waves of layoffs that began in 2022, they will likely exacerbate an ongoing problem: the lack of women on leadership teams. The industry is already starting at a disadvantage, with the share of women in middle management and senior leadership roles remaining stubbornly below 30%. The ongoing layoffs—many targeted at midlevel managers—will compound the challenge.

We recently surveyed approximately 1,800 midlevel and senior leaders in the US to identify the key barriers to advancement for women in tech. (See “Our Research Methodology.”) This research is the latest in a series of analyses about women in technology. One central finding this year is that midlevel management is a key juncture for job satisfaction in women’s tech careers—and one where many organizations may be falling short because of a set of overlooked “X factors.”

Our annual Women in Tech study, kicked off in2021, sets out to quantify the factors that affect the promotion and retention of women in middle and senior management in technology. The most recent research draws on a survey of approximately 1,800 US tech leaders conducted by BCG in December 2022. Respondents were split approximately evenly between men and women, with roughly half in senior leadership (C-suite, president, or vice president) and the remaining half in middle management (roughly any of four levels below the CEO). All respondents work either in the tech industry, across all corporate functions, or in tech functions such as IT at companies in nontech industries. We also conducted in-depth interviews with more than 50 male and female senior leaders. Our study utilizedBCG’s BLISS Index, a comprehensive, statistically rigorous tool that identifies the factors that influence feelings of inclusion in the workplace and that meaningfully correlate with retention.

Midlevel managers make up the pipeline of future leaders in tech, and our research shows how challenges for women result in not just a glass ceiling but a broken ladder. “I have seen many of the women I admire in tech leave the industry,” said one female senior executive at a global technology company. “It’s important for me to stay and keep the seat I have fought so hard for, especially as certain pockets of tech have gotten worse in gender parity.”

The good news? Although senior women leaders intechnologyaren’t represented in equal numbers with men, they report the highest happiness and motivation levels, and the lowest retention risk, of any group we looked at. In other words, if companies can retain women through their time as middle managers, they have a real chance of seeing those women stay and thrive, rising to the top levels of the organization.



Our survey showed the clear disparities in job satisfaction and overall happiness between men and women across different levels of seniority:","women(14), senior(7), leaders(5), tech(4), management(4), midlevel(4), research(4), levels(4), companies(3), leadership(3), industry(3), middle(3), technology(3), retention(3), men(3)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-women-can-move-past-middle-to-become-future-tech-leaders
Tech Startups Should Prepare Now for the Next IPO Boom,"July 19, 2023","The window of opportunity for initial public offerings slammed shut in 2022 amid heightened volatility and plunging valuations. The global technology sector, in particular, experienced a sharp decline—a 60% drop from 661 IPOs in 2021 to a mere 221 in 2022. So far in 2023, the number of new listings remains stubbornly low.

Counterintuitive as it may seem, today’s adverse market conditions provide an ideal moment for technology startups to lay the groundwork for going public. With preparation typically taking 12 to 18 months, initiating the process now will ensure that companies are positioned at the front of the queue once capital market conditions improve and the IPO window reopens.

Meticulous preparation will be essential to make a splash in the next IPO wave. Tech startups must demonstrate a clear path to profitability, provide industry-specific evidence of robust growth, assemble an experienced management team, and confirm their operational readiness for the public sphere. By addressing these topics, startups can craft a strong business plan and compelling equity story that set them apart from the competition and secure their spot as industry trailblazers.



Fueled by low interest rates, technology companies enjoyed a period of substantial growth in the years leading up to 2021. Although the pandemic disrupted macroeconomic conditions in 2020 and 2021, many of these companies benefited from the accelerated adoption of digitization and virtual experiences. From 2012 through 2021, the market capitalization of public tech companies grew by a factor of 7.5, compared with 3.75 for the S&P 500, 3.0 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and 1.3 for the FTSE 100.","public(4), companies(4), technology(3), market(3), conditions(3), startups(3), window(2), low(2), preparation(2), ipo(2), tech(2), growth(2)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/tech-startups-should-prepare-now-for-the-next-ipo-window-boom
Don’t Throw Away the Opportunity in E-Waste,"June 26, 2023","Garbage in, value out?

Every year, nearly $10 billion in electronic waste—comprising computer equipment and devices, screens, and small electronic appliances—is thrown away in the US alone. Most of the value loss comes from embedded metals, such as copper, gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. But these products also contain metals such as mercury, cadmium, and lead that can threaten environmental health and well-being. Globally, only about 20% of this waste is recycled, and without intervention, the volume of e-waste will increase.

At the same time, demand for e-waste materials is on the rise, fueled by multiple factors. Consumers and OEMs are reexamining their resource footprints and searching for circular materials. Primary production of many metals is becoming more costly as ore quality in the ground declines and extraction energy and capital costs rise. Geopolitical pressures have increased the urgency of localizingsupply chains,with a focus on critical minerals.

Companies in numerous industries, among themtelecommunications,IT, metals,retail,manufacturing, and waste management, have an opportunity to recapture the lost value in e-waste and gain from powerful co-benefits.

E-waste generation is expected to more than double by 2050, according to the United Nations Environment Programme, with global volumes rising from 50 million tons to 110 million tons. The growth will be fueled in part by shorter product life cycles (the average smartphone is replaced every 2.2 years) and theInternet of Things, which is lifting the volume of internet-enabled household appliances (the average US household now owns 20 such devices).

US recycling rates vary by state, but the vast majority of e-waste nationwide (80% to 85% by our estimates, worth about $10 billion annually) ends up in landfills or unaccounted for.

Game Changer: Accelerating the Media Industry’s Most Dynamic Sector,"June 09, 2023","The gaming sector is unique. Originally viewed as a children’s diversion, attracting limited attention compared to TV, movies, or music, gaming is now by far the fastest growing sector of the media industry. With the average player age recently exceeding 30 years old,gaming is now the second largest media sectorthat is about to reach $200 billion.11Newzoo, OvumNotes:1Newzoo, OvumGaming IP has become key to attracting new audiences, indicating future growth potential. As part of BCG’s series of gaming reports, following on from ‘Gaming & Esports Media’s Next Paradigm SHIFT’, this report aims to map gaming’s current spectacular journey, highlighting some key trends and opportunities both globally and in the Middle East, which business leaders and companies can leverage to join this dynamic sector.

Gaming is on the rise



Paul Dawalibi is a technology entrepreneur, investor, and gaming & esports expert. As the CEO of Holodeck Media, Paul is building exciting metaverse, gaming and web3 projects. He also hosts Game Changers, a gaming and metaverse show on CNBC Arabia. He is a frequent speaker at metaverse and gaming conferences, and co-authored the book ‘Metaverse Dream’.Paul, you recently moved from US to the Middle East. What excites you about the gaming sector in this region?Paul Dawalibi: For years now, I’ve been saying that the world is sleeping on a massive gaming opportunity in the Middle East. Everyone talks about Asia, but the real gaming powerhouse will be the GCC region due to several factors.  There’s a confluence of factors that gets me excited about gaming in the Middle East.First, the Middle Eastern populations, especially Saudi Arabia, are young and digital savvy. Seventy percent of Saudi Arabia’s population is below the age of 30. Average disposable income is higher. The hot weather means people spend more time inside, which makes gaming an obvious choice of activity and recreation.The second factor that gets me excited is the significant government commitment. Saudi Arabia has committed to investing $38 billion in gaming companies. Abu Dhabi provides strong incentives and benefits to gaming companies that set up shop in the emirate.The third factor is tourism. The UAE is obviously a tourism hotspot already, so there is a significant opportunity to provide visitors with gaming and esports related experiences. Saudi Arabia is also making a big tourism push, so gaming and esports would provide something unique to market to the world.Finally, gaming is a global industry, and the Middle East is truly at the crossroads between East and West. This gives gaming companies operating in the Middle East a distinct advantage in being able to serve North American, European, and Asian customers with equal ease.Paul, focusing on the gaming and esports efforts in the Middle East: what’s your view, and how do other major sector centers see them?Paul Dawalibi: A lot of the conversation around gaming in the Middle East has been dominated by Saudi Arabia, which isn’t surprising given its large-scale financial commitments to boost the sector. Most of the western world is not aware at all of what’s going on in the Middle East when it comes to gaming, beyond a few – not always favorable – press releases. While the path forward for Saudi Arabia is bright, it still needs to address several challenges to realize its ambition. It especially needs to attract experienced human capital with deep industry knowledge, and redouble marketing efforts to the West and East to draw both partners and talent.But Dubai and Abu Dhabi have a major opportunity to compete with Saudi Arabia. The UAE has great infrastructure and easy access to talent from around the world. What the UAE lacks is a cohesive emirates-wide gaming vision and strategy backed by sufficient funding. As interests might diverge in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and other free zones, it could be more challenging to reach the required scale.Over the past decade there has been a lot of buzz around the gaming opportunity in China, and Asia in general. But this region faces a number of challenges and hurdles. While the population sizes are large, disposable income and average spend per player in this region are actually quite low. China has also spent the last couple of years restricting gaming, and approving only few new games for distribution in the country. In fact, we’ve seen Asian gaming companies like Tencent and Netease building their presence in the Middle East because they realize that the opportunity in the region is greater.Paul, we see more and more industries getting interested in gaming. Gaming IPs are leveraged for Hollywood blockbusters. Technology companies and VCs make major investments. Just hype, or the beginning of a longer journey?Paul Dawalibi: Gaming and gaming principles (gamification) will inevitably either intersect or completely disrupt every industry on the planet. So we are just at the beginning of a very long journey for the sector as a whole.Content and IP will be important pillars of this multi-trillion-dollar sector. Technology and infrastructure will also be key growth areas. Brands and traditional entertainment embrace gaming because of the still massively untapped value of the gaming audience. It’s also inevitable that we will see an increase in investment and venture capital to match. If the next few years bring recession, gaming will once again demonstrate that it’s one of the most recession-proof industries on the planet.In fact, all of the hype and talk around the metaverse is fundamentally just gaming. The metaverse is just a fancier word for gaming (especially if we define gaming as the creation of virtual worlds). The word “metaverse” feels more “adult” than gaming, which is often perceived as a hobby just for kids. The result is that billions have been poured into companies that are fundamentally gaming businesses (but calling themselves metaverse). The metaverse concept also makes it far more palatable to bring gaming into the workplace, or into education or government - all areas where metaverse has seen tremendous penetration but is still just gaming or gamification.AI also has deep connections to gaming. The same underlying technologies that enable virtual worlds (e.g., GPUs built by Nvidia) also power the biggest AI models. The breakthroughs in parallel computing that enable AI wouldn’t have been possible without gamers spending money to make their games look more realistic. AI will give back in equal amounts to the gaming industry, as virtual worlds get populated with NPCs (non-player characters) that are so realistic they become indistinguishable from human players.Paul, any closing remarks?Paul Dawalibi: The one consistent trend over human history is that as technology progresses, our leisure time increases. As machines and AI do more work for us than ever before, we will have more free time to spend on recreation. This is how gaming becomes the biggest industry on the planet. And the Middle East is best positioned to capture trillions of dollars of new value that will be created by gaming and metaverse over the next decade.



The COVID-19 pandemic spurred growth in various media and technology sectors in 2020. Within media, gaming outpaced other segments with an 8% growth rate to reach $198 billion (versus TV's 1% decline to $408 billion33Newzoo, Ovum, OmdiaNotes:3Newzoo, Ovum, Omdia). The sector’s growth slowed in 2022 for several reasons, including the end of pandemic shutdowns and Apple’s privacy changes affecting mobile gaming ads. The market size dropped to $184.4 billion44Newzoo""The Global Gaming Market Per Segment 2022”Notes:4Newzoo""The Global Gaming Market Per Segment 2022”, with mobile gaming accounting for 50% of revenues.

However, the industry is expected to resolve these challenges and recover in mid-term, as games become more embedded in everyday life (Exhibit 1). Games have consistently held a 40% share of global mobile app downloads over the past 5 years. The number is even higher in the Middle East, reaching 45-50% in 2020.55App AnnieNotes:5App Annie","middle(11), gaming(10), metaverse(10), sector(9), east(9), industry(7), companies(7), media(6), arabia(6), years(5), growth(5), esports(5), technology(5), region(5), opportunity(5)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/drivers-of-global-gaming-industry-growth
"For Chip Makers, Productivity Is an Untapped Source of Resilience","June 01, 2023","Cyclical demand and risks to Asia-based supply chains require more resilience than ever from USsemiconductormanufacturers. Many companies see investing in domestic production capacity as the solution, and recent government incentives reinforce this view. But adding capacity through capital expenditures (capex) is costly and slow and restricts flexibility when demand changes. What’s more, higher capital intensity hurts stock market performance.

Chip makers should consider a different strategy. Rather than relying on capex, they can expand the capacity of their fabrication plants by improving productivity. This approach helps companies swiftly respond to demand fluctuations, reduces the risk of overinvestment, and enhances financial returns.

For companies that invest in productivity, the improvement opportunities are substantial. A BCG benchmarking study found significant productivity gaps in tool uptime, standby time, and speed. By identifying bottlenecks, setting ambitious performance goals, and evaluating improvement levers, chip makers can boost fab productivity without using capex. And with the help ofadvanced digital tools, chip makers can create innovative solutions to tackle chronic or systemic productivity losses.

Semiconductor manufacturers are no strangers to uncertainty and the need forresilience. For decades, cyclical demand has featured persistently across their business landscape. The recent environment has been especially challenging, with the pandemic causing a severe chip shortage, followed by a sharp drop in demand. At the same time, the concentration of production capacity in Asia has made chip makers vulnerable to geopolitical risks and supply chain disruptions.

To enhance the stability of their production networks, US-based manufacturers are ramping up capacity in North America. Indeed, the federal government (through the CHIPS Act of 2022) and local governments have provided incentives that encourage semiconductor companies to invest capital to build or expand fabs domestically.

Using capex to expand capacity, however, has important drawbacks.

Investments—building a leading-edge fabrication plant, for example—are growing more expensive and time-consuming as process nodes become smaller and critical equipment supply tightens. As a result, this approach does not help manufacturers ramp up and scale down capacity quickly.

Considering the downside, we believe that semiconductor manufacturers should prioritize capex-free expansion to build their resilience. That will enable companies to quickly ramp up capacity when demand rises. Conversely, when demand declines, no investment is lost. In our experience, while investors recognize the capital-intensive nature of semiconductor manufacturing, they are typically wary of companies with high capital intensity, and they reward companies that demonstrate efficient capital deployment.

Productivity improvement is a crucial aspect of capex-free capacity expansion. Our research indicates that many semiconductor manufacturers are operating below optimal production levels, leading to decreased wafer output and margin erosion. Companies should maximize productivity improvements before pursuing other avenues for capex-free expansion, such as outsourcing andproduction as a service, or relying on alternative sources of capital, such as government funding or customer investments.

A recent BCG benchmarking study of fab performance found wide productivity gaps between leading and lagging players, indicating that laggards have significant room for improvement. The benchmarking focused on tool uptime, standby time, and speed.

Uptime.In many process areas, the tool uptime of leading companies exceeds that of laggards by 10% or more. (See the exhibit.) For lithography,often considered the most critical process area, the gap exceeds 20% for mature process nodes in a 300-millimeter fab. The size of the gaps suggests that laggards could increase their annual output by tens of thousands of wafers. Lost uptime results from various factors, such as issues with maintenance scheduling, spare parts inventory management, and a lack of standardization in maintenance procedures.","companies(9), capacity(9), productivity(8), demand(7), capital(6), chip(5), semiconductor(5), manufacturers(5), production(4), capex(4), makers(4), improvement(4), uptime(4), process(4), many(3)",https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/for-chip-makers-productivity-is-an-untapped-source-of-resilience
